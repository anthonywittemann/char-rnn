1) ran jerseyshore with default options except running on opencl
   
   th sample.lua cv/lm_lstm_epoch15.67_1.2910.t7

    - tried the previous command, and got an error
    - I apparently overfit b/c the training error at the end was around 1.0, but the validation error at its lowest was around 1.29
    - Solution to overfitting according to Karpathy - increase dropout or decrease size of network
    
    
2) ran lotr: th train.lua -data_dir data/lotr -opencl 1

	th sample.lua cv/lm_lstm_epoch28.10_1.1723.t7
	
	- got the same result as above
	- I'm going to try training them now on the cpu without opencl, 
	- I'll also increase dropout for jerseyshore, increase size for lotr

The long stars were all the hobbits and had seemed to be such a man of men, and the halfling was set out of the House of the North. The light of the wind was drawing near the sun with a strange stone, and a shining hollow had fled above the stone that had been become a strange house of the feet of a stars and shadowy stones. The silence sat before them came the hobbits and a hundred stone bent for a while that he had to look about them. But it was many many strength to tell him with long things with the rider and led them on the grey breach. It came to a long way and spoke of the hobbits and he had dreamed in the hobbits, and the pale road was wild and dark in the walls of the Citadel. The hobbits had fallen high and stared at them. But the morning stronger than a hobbit as he was fell and the great cry of the Gate was heavy. The light had been flying in the darkness and was shining and suddenly the last strength that he would not see their will and show them. They looked on a deep stone standing shadow and despair on the great heart of the walls of the great stream and the others stood in a broad western step of stars to the sun. And the water was gathering up and swiftly away to the hobbits when they had remembered that they stood again. There was a great left was a few more on the floor of the forest where the sun was already provided him to have been found, and they saw the place of the bank of the trees and the light of the further side of the heart of the walls and the heart of the pale steps of the small white fire.

The silence in upon the right the Ring, beyond the road upon the air, and they walked in light that appeared a cortion of stone that he had been seen with the people, and shapeless eyes that turned from the means of his own.
‘No not on it now!' said Aragorn. 'He is that much thought you will bear the Road so I can think of your face, unterise telling banged to the forest. He's ready upon the glade of the speech of Middle-earth. But the Ring could come down to him with long in Orcs and was forced to stand up our little arch on the mountains, and both would not danger all at any rate with Last The Haulent house. And then maybe the folk is weary of your land. He takes a great stars which Aragorn live before we were to the downs of the Ring.
