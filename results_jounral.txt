1) ran jerseyshore with default options except running on opencl
   
   th sample.lua cv/lm_lstm_epoch15.67_1.2910.t7

    - tried the previous command, and got an error
    - I apparently overfit b/c the training error at the end was around 1.0, but the validation error at its lowest was around 1.29
    - Solution to overfitting according to Karpathy - increase dropout or decrease size of network
    
    
2) ran lotr: th train.lua -data_dir data/lotr -opencl 1

	th sample.lua cv/lm_lstm_epoch28.10_1.1723.t7
	
	- got the same result as above
	- I'm going to try training them now on the cpu without opencl, 
	- I'll also increase dropout for jerseyshore, increase size for lotr
	
ROUND 2:
1) th train.lua -data_dir data/jerseyshore -gpuid -1 -dropout 0.5
