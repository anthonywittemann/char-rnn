<p> I was excited to see the net could learn the general structure of a TV script but at the same time not very impressed with the content as there was a lot of nonsense such as "What we're not afsepbation". I decided to tame the wild output by decreasing the temperature.</p>

<p> Good, I got significantly less gobbledygook words, but only small chunks of words actually make sense together. Context usually dissapears after 20-30 characters. Next, I wanted to see if I could get the net to spit out some more creative text without adding too much gobbledygook.</p>

<p>As expected, we got more nonsensical output. One thing the rnn learned the food prefences of the show characters: "I like Italian". Bravo char-rnn! For the next sampling, I decided to warm up the network with some typical text from the script and setting the temperature to the value which has previously yielded the most sensible output.</p>
