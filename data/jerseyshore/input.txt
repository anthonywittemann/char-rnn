I'm going to the Jersey shore, bitch! We are here to, like, blow this place apart.
Party's here.
Whoo! - [Laughs] - Oh, my! Sammi, she really, like, surprised me.
Your girlfriend over here hooked up with my boy.
Ronnie's [Bleep]lng hot.
I'm attracted.
They're starting to get to know me.
And they're like, "you know what, snooki? You're a real cool girl.
" I'm like, "thank you.
" Like, finally.
- Oh! - Oh! We pretty much became a family, and we loved each other.
We killed it in Jersey.
It was a blast.
I want this thing forever.
[Cheering] Miami, here we come.
This is nice.
Hello? What up, big pimp? [Shrieks] I love Miami we came down to Miami as one big family.
Everybody was pretty close.
- It's t-shirt time.
Since then, the family isn't exactly the same.
Snook, come to daddy.
Did I bang snooki last night? Like, this big.
Ronnie thinks that by getting into a fight that he's allowed to creep.
I'll go sleep with my girl on the bed.
How about that? You know what I'm saying? Do you think she has a right to know? I mean, I don't know.
Ron made out with two girls.
This is gonna be so bad.
You asked for her number.
I got her number, yes.
She wrote it too! [Bleep] You, Nicole! And your [Bleep]lng sidekick! I'm in your [Bleep]lng face right now.
You called me a [Bleep]! Aah! bye.
Bye.
- He's not even gonna say good-bye to jenni.
Holy [Bleep].
What Ron will do to her in the future will just go to show who was actually there for her and who wasn't.
No! Miami! See ya, Miami! I'm gonna miss you, Miami.
So now it's time for us to shoot back up to Jersey because it's summertime in Jersey.
It's gonna be an unbelievable year, and it's gonna be pretty cool.
Hey, I'm so excited to be back at the Jersey shore house.
[Get crazy by lmfao] Dj pauly delvecchio! I'm going to the Jersey shore, bitch! All right, we got a situation.
I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
[Laughing] After I have sex with a guy, I will rip their heads off.
Go vinny! Go vinny! Um, hello! If you wanna have fun and do something crazy whoo! I'm so excited to go to the Jersey shore.
Oh, yeah! I cannot wait to go to the [Bleep]lng Jersey shore.
Seaside is definitely more of my scene with the guys.
[Spraying] I'm so excited to get back into my house, pop some bottles, and hook up with my roommates.
Is this the wrong heel? [Thud] I look like a hooker.
Sick.
[Whining] [Grunts] [Bleep] My life! I should not be wearing hooker boots.
Oh, God.
I'll just close this.
Aah! [Horn honks] [Laughs] No! I stalled! Hopefully I make it to the shore.
Yeah, buddy.
you know what? Angelina, she's done.
I kicked her ass out in Miami, and I just need a party girl, so I invited my girl deena.
The roommates don't know that I'm doing this.
Deena is like another snooki.
She loves to party.
She loves to be loud and obnoxious.
She doesn't give a [Bleep] About what anybody thinks.
Hello.
That's me.
I'm almost at your house, bitch.
Be excited.
Oh, I'm so excited! Deena is, like, one of my best friends, and she's gonna be my partner in crime.
Oh, jeez Louise.
[Horn honks] Bitch! how ready are you? I missed you.
Me and Nicole are really close, and as soon as I met her, it was like ahhh it was, like, love at first sight.
We started calling each other all the time.
We hung out.
We'd go to clubs.
You know, go guy shopping.
So that's why, like, when she called me and she invited me down, I was like, thank God.
I love you.
Have a great time.
- Bye.
I love you.
- Nice to meet you.
It was so good to meet you.
Girls, knock 'em dead.
Let's go.
Whoo! Bye! I'm so excited! I can't wait.
I'm gonna tell you a little inside scoop about the roommates.
Jenni, you're gonna love jenni, 'cause I love jenni.
We're gonna be, like, three besties.
- Tom? - Yeah.
Can you help me with my bag? Oh, don't break the new thing we just bought.
Me and Tom definitely need a break from each other.
I'll call you when I get there tonight.
[Dog barks] Shut up! We've been getting into, like, some serious fights lately.
I have been really excited to go to Jersey.
Love you.
Away from my long island problems.
Like, long island problems being Tom.
on to the next one.
Pauly, adorable.
You're gonna love him.
You'll probably have sex with him.
- [Laughs] - Just saying.
And then, Mike is, like, a sweet guy.
[Laughs] Vinny, sweetheart.
You're gonna love him.
Oh, I can't wait.
[Laughs] Whew! Smells like the situation.
This is the family shore house, round two.
This is Jersey back again, so I'm pretty excited to be, you know, back where everything had started.
Voila.
We've got this going down.
You're gonna love this.
I bought a little shower caddy so no one can [Bleep] With my shampoo and soaps and stuff.
Um, who am I missing? Oh, Ron and Sam.
Pbbt! [Laughs] That's all I have to say.
Pbbt! I don't know Ronnie anymore.
I used to love him, and in Miami, everything just got [Bleep]Ed up because of Sam, and if I could take it back, what I did with Sam, trying to be a good friend to her, I would.
I'm headed out right now.
I'm gonna go pick up Sam.
We've been together for a year.
We're gonna celebrate when we get down there.
Me and Sammi are pretty good right now.
We took a gigantic step from Miami.
[Bleep] Roller coaster ride that was.
But, uh [Laughs] Miami was hard for me to handle.
I'm still working on things, take it day by day and see what happens.
- Are you ready? - Yeah, are you ready? Yeah.
I just hope that he will never do that to me ever again, 'cause that was a little bit traumatizing.
Bye, guys.
Miss you.
Ronnie, take care of my daughter.
Bye.
Off to the Jersey shore.
Wow, they seem like a good frickin' time.
Hell yeah.
We're gonna hit up karma, we're gonna hit up bamboo.
- Oh, hell yeah.
- Headliners.
- Headliners.
- Has tight pool parties.
Yes.
Can't wait to go guy shopping.
Hell yeah.
Oh, I love faux hawks.
It's my best thing.
Faux hawks? Ron has a faux hawk.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, [Bleep].
- Uh-oh.
[Both laugh] That would be [Bleep]lng hilarious because when Ron gets drunk, he's single.
You never know what happens when you put a little cherry vodka in deena and Nicole's blood, so It definitely is intimidating coming into this as the new girl.
No one knows me yet, so it's just like, hopefully these people like me.
[Laughs] Oh, deena, this is going to be interesting.
I'm going to the Jersey shore.
It's like my second home.
The Jersey shore is in my blood.
My father went to the Jersey shore.
My uncles went to the Jersey shore.
I have to go where I belong.
Like a monkey has to go to the [Bleep]lng jungle, I belong at the Jersey shore.
Last summer was crazy on the Jersey shore.
I actually miss it.
I miss the boardwalk.
I miss the beach.
I miss the clubs.
But we are absolutely gonna top last summer.
I'm gonna miss you.
- Miss you too.
Love you.
All right.
Hold it down over here for me.
You look like you're all set.
Gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too.
I'll call you.
Bye.
Love you.
Love you.
it's so sad.
[riders screaming] This time hell is gonna hear us live life what the [Bleep]'S up in this bitch? No one.
Yeah, [Bleep].
We're the first one to arrive in the house.
Oh, the duck phone.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe I'm back.
Seriously.
[Laughs] Yeah, we're sleeping up here.
Bring your stuff up here.
You know, I arrived first, so nobody else was there, so I was able to choose from any room I wanted, and I kind of figured, old room upstairs is much nicer than downstairs.
There's three beds in there.
As long as I'm with Ron, anybody else can come stay with us.
Like, it's not gonna be awkward.
Who do you think's coming next? Probably Mike.
I have a feeling the whore bag's gonna be next.
[Car door shuts] Oh, somebody's here.
You you hear? You hear people? [Laughs] - Who is it? - Go upstairs.
- Who is it? - You were right.
- Whore bag? - Yeah.
I'm helping her with nothing.
- Just whore? - Yeah.
Oh, my God.
I hope she [Bleep]S herself when she sees me.
[Groans] [Laughs] Party's here, times two! Hi, I'm deena.
Nice to meet you.
Everyone was so nice, but Sam, she was like, "uhh! Hi.
" She's laughing at me.
I definitely am.
I didn't have any problems with you ever, and now I do.
[Rock music] me and Ron and Sam have not spoken since Miami.
Um, I have no intention of patching [Bleep] Up.
It's too late.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop! - [Bleep]! Hey, stop! Go upstairs.
I'm pretty sure jwoww's gonna come running up here, knowing that this is, like, the best room in the house, and Ron goes into the bathroom and leaves me out in the, like, hallway with the luggages.
You know what I mean? - Uhh! - [Laughs] Hello, I'm here in the room you wanted, and, um, I think she almost [Bleep] Herself, Ron and Sam took the upstairs room, which basically [Bleep]Ed it up for everybody in the house.
I hope they get at [Bleep]lng incurable disease living up there.
yeah, it's vin.
Now everyone's a martian, alien thank God.
Vinny! Wow, it's like a time warp.
Okay, so Ron and Sam are upstairs.
- Upstairs where? - In that room.
The three bedroom.
The three bedroom? The nice bathroom with the upgraded bedroom.
So where the [Bleep] Should I sleep? You could take that bed if you want.
There's nobody there's nobody on that side.
I don't want to sleep in here.
[Bleep]! We're not gonna do anything.
I'm not sleeping in here.
[Laughs] I think it's weird that Ronnie and Sammi took the bedroom upstairs with three beds in it.
I'm just gonna pick this room over here.
Even if I'm best friends in the world with them, I want a room where I can bring girls back to and [Bleep].
You know? And that's I can't do it in front of Sammi.
hey yeah who is it? Pauly? Your boyfriend? - Of course.
See how excited he is? He's like a little kid.
Look, he's so excited.
Look.
Ma? Ma? [Laughter] Yo, what up, pimp? We got our duck phone back.
What's going on? Good to see you.
Good to see you.
- How are you doing? - Hi.
- Good.
What's going on? - What's up? Yo, where am I sleeping? [Laughter] I got a bed for you, dog.
This one's mine.
All right, straight.
Yeah, definitely.
The room situation's all screwed up.
Like, Ronnie and Sam are upstairs, and there's an extra bed with them, kind of awkward.
It's like, I don't want to get that room, the boring room.
But there's a bed right next to vinny's, which is I'm cool with that.
I'll just I'll just bunk with vinny.
What is that, vin? Oh, it's my sh it's my shower caddy.
Oh.
You never heard of a shower caddy, dog? Yo, vinny's mad funny.
Like, it's a cool idea.
A shower caddy's great.
But you're a dude.
So I gotta let everybody know vinny has a shower caddy.
Yo, when we meet you on the boardwalk, I'm gonna be like, "yo.
" - It's his shower caddy.
He got a shower caddy.
Oh, lookit.
A loofa.
Yo, can I use it, dog? [Laughter] I'm in seaside, bitch.
Remember the bottle that I told you I was gonna pop open when I get there? - You opened it already.
- I did.
You're such a whore.
Before I left my house, I definitely opened the bottle and took, like, three shots.
So would I, if I wasn't driving.
[Laughs] I'm nervous, I'm excited, and I just can't wait to, like, blow the [Bleep]lng speakers off this house.
But don't tell anybody I'm drunk I'm just gonna walk in like I'm a good time.
- [Bleep].
- [Laughs] If you think you got it come on now - let's go, bitch.
- All right.
I'm just really, really excited to, like, be back in seaside.
This is like gorilla juicehead guido heaven.
Snooki did come with someone.
Oh, my God.
This brings back memories! Are you ready? Boo-boo! Oh, my God, I missed you! I've got a girl.
Deena.
- Hi, new roommate.
- New roommate, bitches.
- New roommate.
- Party's here, times two! - Party of two's here.
Snooki! What up? - Hello! I'm your new roommate.
Snooki walks through the door with this gremlin lookalike, and she says she's the new roommate.
Hi, I'm deena.
Nice to meet you.
What's her name? Diana? Deena? She looks exactly like snooki.
Like, four feet tall.
Short, little, like, meatball.
Exactly like snooki.
She looks like she's ready to party, I'm just saying.
She is.
Double trouble.
Double trouble right here.
Where's our room? - Whoops, sorry.
I brought deena inside the house, everyone was so nice.
But Sam, she was like, "uhh! Hi.
" Like her little valley girl self.
- Deena? - Yeah.
Okay.
Deena.
You can call me Dee.
Deena Nicole, whatever you want.
- I wanted us three to room.
- We are, right here.
- How fun.
- Yay.
You're gonna be my new best friend.
- It'll be fun.
- This is it? They [Bleep]Ed it up.
Yeah, they [Bleep]Ed it up.
So now it's pauly and vinny and us three.
Well, good.
So the good people are downstairs.
Yeah.
And the [Bleep]Ers are upstairs.
I'm a little pissed off because Ron and Sam got that room.
But jenni is a doll, and she picked the room with three beds.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Thank God, because if I didn't live with one of those two, I'd probably kill myself.
what's up, bitches? Whoo! Snooki and deena taking over this town! What do you think of her? She looks like a gremlin.
I thought she was gonna be hot.
And I'm a little I'm a little taken aback, right? I'm in this house with now three girls, and apparently deena knows snooki from home, so they're bff.
And now it's three against one.
Snooki's [Bleep]lng jenni's bitch.
The girl's probably gonna be snooki's bitch.
It's me against this whole house.
Do you get that? What are the situations with the rooms right now? - You're upstairs.
- Wow.
Just looking at Mike, you see "miserable" tattooed on his forehead.
That's a bad situation.
He [Bleep]Ed my best friend right in front of me.
What do you mean? I saw your [Bleep]lng ass, jerkoff! [Rock music] you masterbatin'? Yo, I have a vibrator if you need it.
I'm on a two-month dry spell.
I haven't had sex in two months.
There's not a chance.
There's not a chance it's happening.
So hopefully I'll find somebody.
Do you want to see mine? I'll show you mine.
Show me it.
Do you have the rabbit? I call my vibrator the elmo, because "tickle me, elmo," you know what I mean? Yes.
- She's green.
- That's it? Listen, honey, this [Bleep] Does wonders.
[Laughs] But, you know, I have vinny in the house now, so maybe I don't need the vibrator.
We'll see.
I love this room.
I feel like this is, like, yesterday.
Damn, I don't see it.
I'm feeling really good.
I'm excited.
I'm back in my home area, and I'm just looking forward to seeing everybody right now.
- Mike! - Oh! Oh, my God.
What up? Man, how is this place? What's the deal, man? What's what is everybody doing? How are you doing, man? Listen, I need to tell you something.
- Hi, I'm your new roomie.
- Oh, yeah? Okay.
- Angelina isn't coming back.
- Hi, how are you? Oh, that's fantastic.
Is everybody here? Am I the last one? - Yep.
- Yeah.
- For real? - Yeah.
What's what's the sit what are the situations with the rooms right now? Are they the same rooms or no? - You're upstairs.
- What? I'm upstairs? - Yeah.
- I'm upstairs? For real? I actually feel bad for Mike because he really got the [Bleep] End of the stick.
Nobody wanted to room with Ron and Sam.
What is it? Where is it at? - Sam's old bedroom.
- Who's in it's Sam's old bed? Yeah.
Unfortunately, it could have been mvp in that room.
Uh, Mikey-vinny-pauly.
Why Ron and Sam would pick a room with three beds, uh, is definitely sort of baffling.
Wow.
It sucks being the last person.
Whatever.
Just looking at Mike, you see "miserable" tattooed on his forehead.
That's a bad situation.
Wow.
- burgers for the boys.
- I'm hungry.
- Chef boyar-vin.
Supposedly it's 80% lean, That's how I like my women.
I thought it was the other way around.
[Both laugh] You see snooki's hair? Doesn't she look like a fireball? - She does.
- I love it.
- She's like a firecracker.
- I am.
[Laughter] Jersey.
Where? I live in Jersey also.
Bitch, I'm here.
I know every part of Jersey.
Just tell me where the [Bleep] You're from.
Like what part? It was very disrespectful.
Sammi kind of just, like, looked at her with disgust.
That's just rude.
I'm new, so I was like, I'm gonna come in here with an open mind, and I tried.
It's gonna be three against one.
Okay, you guys want to eat inside? Yo, snook's friend is hot.
She can get it.
You mean your new roommate.
Do you have a job? Yeah, I'm a dental assistant and I waitress.
Who else was a dental assistant? Angelina! Today's the last day we're even gonna mention that girl's name.
[Laughter] Um, I love to have a good time.
I'm single, ready to mingle, and I'm just like a walking holiday.
Oh, nice.
A walking holiday? Like, what does that mean? Are you gonna give out candy? Like, I don't get it.
You seem like a fun time.
You really do.
I'm a blast in a glass.
This is a blast in a glass.
If deena was a holiday, she'd definitely be Thanksgiving, 'cause she's got a lot to give and she's down for a lot of stuffing.
[Laughs] Here's to a good summer and a blast! Yes, yes, yes.
Cheers, cheers.
Cheers.
[Bleep].
- Yeah, no.
I'm not gonna cheer to deena.
No.
- All right.
- Nice to meet you.
Welcome to the family.
- Nice to meet you.
- We are like a family.
I'm glad that you guys are welcoming and not like this bitch.
"Get out of here.
" No, with all seriousness, I think the way you treat people in this house is the way you're gonna get it back.
Yeah, absolutely.
I'm a very respectful person, but if, like, someone should step on my toes, like, I probably will be the same way.
Well, we're all the same.
It's like, if you can't take the heat, get the [Bleep] Out of the kitchen.
You know? All right.
Whoa! I swear to God, if vinny hooks up with this girl, done ties with vinny.
Sammi's like, "[Bleep].
" I hope she rots in hell.
You come into this [Bleep]lng house! This is my [Bleep]lng house! I think we're gonna play flip cup before we go.
Oh, flip the cup? I love flip the cup! Flip the cup! Flip the cup! We decided to play flip cup 'cause we want to stay in, and of course, Ron and Sam are nowhere to be seen.
It just goes to show that they're not willing to participate in the household.
Like, they're dead.
- flip the cup, flip the cup.
- Me, me, who's next? Win, win! When I see everybody drinking with me, it's like hallelujah, hallelujah - default.
The wind.
- What wind? You gotta deal with the elements.
You gotta deal with the elements.
- Go.
- [Bleep]lng wind.
What are they doing? They're on the porch or something.
I can't deal with [Bleep]lng meatballs.
Let's get wasted okay, drink it.
Just drink it.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! [Cheering] First shot! [Laughter] The drunks are your friends we'll just sit here wasting our time hold on.
Let's take a winner pose.
And then you woke up and [Bleep].
Did we ever lose at anything? No.
Good point.
There's nobody listenin' what would you do if you were me right now? You don't know what I'm going through right now.
I do.
Don't tell me I don't.
'Cause you know I do.
And I want you to know I like you.
I'm madly in love with you.
I want to be there for you.
Why? Because you're my girlfriend.
- Hot tub.
- Whoo-hoo! Oh, yes, jacuzzi! Cheers, to you inviting me.
Whoa! I like the middle.
We're in the hot tub and there's an issue.
As of right now, I'm a little upset with vinny.
Maybe he wants to be with deena.
I don't know.
This drink you made was awesome.
Thank you.
Whatever you did.
Here.
I made a blast in your glass.
I swear to God, if vinny hooks up with this girl, done ties with vinny.
Done ties.
What do you want to do? What do you want me to do? - What are you talking about? - Hello.
All I know is, I'm having a blast.
I love it how [Bleep]lng funny it is that you [Bleep] Have sex with my best friend.
- Who? - Ryder.
Like, two weeks ago, vinny hooked up with my best friend ryder.
Like, legit, had sex to where I walked in and saw them.
That's not okay.
Ew! Oh, yeah, for sure, right.
I hooked up with snooki's friend ryder.
Like, I didn't know it was a problem.
It was just like, we were all out one night.
I don't feel I was wrong by doing it.
He [Bleep]Ed my best friend right in front of me.
I don't know what you want me to do.
Like, you like guys.
You have boyfriends, like but I didn't have sex with them like that.
What? Like like what? I saw your [Bleep] [Bleep], jerkoff! Oh, my God.
He [Bleep]Ed ryder.
- Dun dun dun - [Laughs] So, what's it like, being a dental assistant? Oh, my God.
This is not a good time.
Like, this is like the most horrible time ever.
You're such a jerkoff.
Fine.
Be like that.
You don't realize how much I care about you and how much I like you.
I care about you the same exact way.
Ah, you don't.
When I told you that I had feelings for you and then you [Bleep]lng go and, like, smush my best friend, that's not okay.
I'm sorry if I hurt you, but, you know, that's not what I intended.
I give up.
No, nothing.
You're gonna hook up with grenades, but you can't [Bleep]lng make out with me? Are you serious? I don't understand how you could have sex with Angelina and then I try and hook up with you don't ever even look at me the same way.
Or don't even ever try to hook up with me like that.
'Cause I don't want to hurt you, and I won't.
'Cause I don't want to hurt you.
- It's over.
- Oh! whoo I gotta let you know you really broke my heart I'm I'm sorry I have a [Bleep]lng penis.
Stick it in one of the jet holes.
I'm going to bed.
Oh Mike, come on.
You're not gonna believe the new chick.
She's totally getting butt naked.
[Bleep]! You laughed at me for no reason! I still laughing at you.
[Bleep] You! [Rock music] [laughs] We're just trying to have a good time this summer.
That's it.
You are a blast and a holiday.
Wait, where's my [Bleep]lng blast in a glass hat? I don't know.
You have a you have a blast in a glass hat? Yes.
Where is my hat? You're looking for your lucky hat? Yeah.
I can go find your lucky hat.
Do you want to come with? Yeah, um, let's go find it.
Cowboy hat is probably another term for deena's kooka.
All right.
Well, let's survey the area from here.
Okay, with the words.
Let's just [Bleep]lng find my hat.
[Laughs] Where's my hat? We'll find it.
You help me.
Mike, come on.
Help me find my hat.
Should I get this or my cowboy hat? - Yes, your lucky hat.
- Wah.
Let's find your cowboy hat.
Deena is awkwardly cute and, uh, we got a situation.
Here's my cowboy hat.
I can see it now.
I-I can see it.
You look you look good.
So you, like, wave it in the air and stuff? And I have to [lndistinct] In my bikini, like this.
- Uh-huh.
- And just have a good time.
Oh, wow.
Really? It looks like a good time.
Everything looks situated.
[Laughs] This woman starts to, you know, pull their dress on.
As she's doing that, she's totally getting butt naked.
[Laughs] Subtlety is underrated no, you can't do it.
No, you can't do it now.
Do I really want to do this right now? Does the situation want to get situated right now? You hit like a in the house home run just now.
No, I don't even want to talk about it, because that was really bad.
- In the house home run.
And, um, the answer is, day one, I had to pull the eject button.
Pssh! You look great.
Listen, you look you look awesome.
When Mike saw my nahnah, I was just like, oh, my God.
Like, a day? Really? It took a day for somebody to see my goods.
I can't.
You are in great shape right now.
This is only between me and you.
I'm downstairs, right? Are you talking [Beep] Already? - Not yet.
- This is not bad! You tried bending over the bed.
Let's get this situation straight.
What? This needs to be gracefully explained.
She goes, "get my cowboy hat.
" So I'm like, "yo, you got cowboy boots?" She's like, "no," she's like, "but I look good with just the hat on.
" So, you know, she goes, "and my bikini.
" So she closed her eyes, and as she was doing it, she took everything off, like like, every and I guess she didn't know that it was off.
[Laughs] She's like like, still with her eyes closed.
She's butt naked.
She's butt naked.
Deena accidentally showed her kooka to Mike.
Man, every first day in Jersey, just something crazy goes down.
Hey, you.
If I see your [Bleep]lng penis rise, I'm going to bed.
That's all I'm saying.
he saw my nahnah.
Why don't you put some pajamas on? You know, that's a good situation.
Should I put on sexy pajamas? Where are you going? I think I'm just gonna hide in my room.
You have no idea what just happened.
What? She's really drunk, I guess.
I don't even know if she's drunk or if she's just Stupid? - Whatever, yeah.
- I'm gonna go with stupid.
[Laughs] Where is everybody? They're sleeping.
We're gonna wake them up.
Uh, I'm not going upstairs.
Who is sleeping? Oh, my God.
She's on crack if she goes upstairs.
Nobody has ever, ever gotten butt, butt, butt naked.
She did.
[Laughs] Mike, you have [Bleep], all right? Wake the [Bleep] Up.
What do you mean, wake up? - Wake up.
- For what? We're trying to have a good time.
You're annoying.
[Laughs] - She's laughing at me.
- No, she's not.
I definitely am.
[Laughs] You're the biggest bitch.
I'm here and I'm staying.
- You are a [Bleep]lng slutty-assed bitch! I'll [Bleep]lng pound you! Step out of it! Put your hands on me.
Hit me! where is everybody? We're gonna wake them up.
Uh, I'm not going upstairs.
She's on crack if she goes upstairs.
She's really drunk, I guess.
I don't even know if she's drunk or if she's just Stupid? - Whatever, yeah.
- I'm gonna go with stupid.
[Laughs] Nobody has ever, ever gotten butt, butt, butt naked.
She did.
[Laughs] Mike, you have [Bleep], all right? Wake the [Bleep] Up.
What do you mean, wake up? - Wake up.
- For what? You could tell.
She's like, "Mike," like, all on his bed.
Like like a snooki.
Like, it reminded me of like how snooki would be, going into, like, the guy's room.
Uhh! You're annoying.
Yeah.
You're annoying.
[Laughs] I was drunk.
I wanted to snuggle.
Nothing, like, crazy.
Like, I really just wanted to snuggle, and this bitch laughs.
No, you don't have to leave if you don't want to.
No, I'm fine.
Good night.
Come cuddle with me.
[Laughs] Bitch, I will smack that [Bleep]lng grin right off your face.
Seriously.
She's laughing at me.
She's not laughing at you.
- She is.
- No, she's not.
I definitely am.
I didn't do anything to you.
Okay.
I didn't have any problems with you ever.
Okay.
And now I do.
Hello! And so does everybody else in the house.
Cool.
That's cool.
[Laughs] They're embarrassing, and Sammi's a [Bleep].
- Why? - And that's all.
[Laughs] You want to walk out of my room, calling me a [Bleep].
Can't say it to my face.
Hell yeah.
I have a problem with you now.
- What happened? - She's like a [Bleep] In a bag.
I tried to be nice to this girl.
Who? I hope she rots in hell.
I do.
I will [Bleep]lng knock her out.
Talk all you want.
What happened? What'd I miss? Have I done anything wrong, being in this house? We've been here, like, for five hours.
I don't care.
That was very awkward, very audacious of a rookie What does audacious mean? In calling a veteran I don't really [Bleep]lng care.
I can't believe deena called Sammi the "c" word on the first night.
It's the first night.
Those are fighting words.
You are the blast from the past.
Don't tell me who I am.
What is it, the blast in a cup? I am putting you up for rookie of the year award.
You are going for rookie of the year award.
Not only were you butt naked on the first day you do not talk to me.
Like, I am a good person to everybody, but if you want to laugh at me and make fun of me Yeah.
I will [Bleep]lng make your life miserable.
What holiday is it? Halloween? I love how she's not saying one word to my face.
[Laughs] She's just like snooki.
I'm sitting in bed, I kind of was like brushing it off, and then I say, no.
This bitch, this bitch.
Good, go cuddle with your [Bleep]lng boyfriend.
Don't talk to me.
- Listen.
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.
Then Ron jumps up to go downstairs, and I'm like, who does this girl think she is? Listen, listen.
Don't no, no, no.
Don't get me [Bleep]lng involved, all right, deena? You come into this house, this is my [Bleep]lng house! Listen, bitch, you don't [Bleep]lng know me.
You're in my [Bleep]lng house.
You just walked through the door.
You earn respect in this [Bleep]lng house.
You don't [Bleep]lng just get it.
No, don't get me [Bleep]lng involved! I'm not! You got a problem with my [Bleep]lng girlfriend, you deal with it with her, do you understand me? I'm upstairs no, no, no.
I'm not done talking! I'm not done talking! I'm not done talking, okay? When I'm done, you can talk.
That's the way it works.
All right? - What happened? - This bitch.
Go cuddle with your [Bleep]lng boyfriend.
Listen, listen, listen.
Don't get me [Bleep]lng involved, all right, deena? She just kept talking [Bleep], so I got up and I gave her a piece of my mind.
I'm upstairs no, no, no.
I'm not done talking! When I'm done, you can talk.
That's the way it works.
Yeah, go ahead.
You got a problem with my [Bleep]lng girlfriend, you deal with it with her, so shut the [Bleep] Up! Okay, but she's now laughing at me.
Because no, no, no, no.
Get off of me! I thought it was such a [Bleep] Move when Ronnie came down for Sammi.
Like, let your girlfriend do her fighting battles on her own.
Don't talk to me the way you're talking to me, first of all! And second of all [imitates deena's voice] First of all, second of all.
I don't care who you are! [Monotone] I don't care who you are.
So go upstairs.
I don't I don't know who you think you are.
You don't just go to sleep.
Deena kind of reminded me of, like, a dirty chihuahua, just barking, and, like, you kind of just want to smack it to the side.
I'd rather have [Bleep]lng Angelina back.
Hold on a second.
Don't walk out of my room calling me a [Bleep].
You laughed at me for no reason! Get real! I'm still laughing at you.
- Who are you talking to? - I'm talking to you.
Diana, deena, whatever the [Bleep] Your name is.
Yeah.
I didn't start with you! You're the new girl.
Shut up, you stupid [Bleep].
- Ooh, here it comes.
- You fucking [Bleep]! [Bleep] You! [Bleep] You! [Bleep] You! You don't want to piss off deena like that, because even though we're tiny bitches, I don't give a [Bleep].
I will [Bleep]lng attack you like a squirrel monkey.
Sam, you were such a bitch.
You're a [Bleep], the biggest bitch I've ever met in my entire life.
You are the biggest [Bleep]lng bitch.
I don't understand how you even have friends.
You are the biggest bitch.
I'm here and I'm staying, whether you like it or not.
- You are a [Bleep]lng slutty-assed bitch! Thank you.
You don't give a [Bleep] About anybody else but yourself.
I knew, coming into this house, that there was unfinished drama between Sammi and the girls.
I just didn't think it was gonna come out like this, and I didn't think it was gonna happen on the first day.
You're not a true friend.
You're a backstabbing bitch.
You showed it to me in [Bleep]lng Miami, you [Bleep]lng bitch! You were fake as [Bleep]! You pretended to be my [Bleep]lng friend, and you [Bleep]lng weren't even telling me yourself.
Are you serious? I am dead serious, you [Bleep] Fake bitch! Ron, is she fake? Do you think she's fake? I'm asking you.
- Yeah, she's fake.
Okay, Ronnie, your mom called me every single [Bleep]lng week! "Why the [Bleep] Is my son with this bony-assed bitch?" I might have fabricated a little bit, saying that Ronnie's mom said that Sam is a bitch, but when I said it, Ron didn't say a word.
Like, honestly, I don't know who you think you are, snooki, but I don't know why you would even say things like that.
Even though I don't like you, well, I will always love Ronnie.
He doesn't even [Bleep]lng like you.
All right, snook, you need to relax, 'cause you're a [Bleep]lng loser from poughkeepsie, and you know it.
And you know it! [Bleep]! First of all, come here and I'll [Bleep]lng pound you, bitch! You bitch! Step out of it! Put your hands on me, then.
Yo, babe.
No, stop! Some people right here.
Jersey shore! Jersey shore! Jersey shore! Hold up, get a drink in your cup last summer was crazy on the Jersey shore, but we know each other now.
We're gonna hit Jersey hard.
That was so much fun! We've got a new roommate, and we all welcomed deena in with open arms.
- Mvpd.
- Mvpd.
- are we good? - Yeah.
Aah! [Horn blows] This is gonna feel a little uncomfortable.
[High-pitched squeak] - [Laughs] - [Groans] Where's the beach? Where the [Bleep]'S the beach? Where? Nicole! I did nothing [Bleep]lng wrong! Tom totally broke up with jenni.
[Crying] I don't deserve this.
[Bleep], do whatever the [Bleep] You want.
I'm done with this [Bleep].
[Crying] - Oh! - Oh! [Bleep] Stabbed me in the [Bleep] Back! I've never stabbed you in the back! And now I [Bleep]lng see it.
The dynamic definitely has changed.
You know, it's not one big happy family anymore.
Are you friends with her? I'm sorry for the next bitch you [Bleep]lng take over.
I hate you! INeed to go.
Aah! Ew, get the [Bleep] Off my arm.
You're talking to a police officer like that.
I don't care.
I'm a [Bleep]lng good person.
Is she gonna be all right, though? Aw, [Bleep].
[Siren] It wasn't all fun.

I'M SURPRISED.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY WOULD GO.
- I FEEL LIKE THEY WENT OUT TO DINNER.
- IF THEY WENT OUT TO DINNER, I WILL NOT COOK-- I WILL NOT EVEN SET A PLACE FOR THEM.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THEY TAKE THE CAR THE WHOLE DAY AND BOUNCE, YOU KNOW.

THEY WANNA EAT WITHOUT US? EAT WITHOUT US.
IT'S NOT AFFECTING ME, THOUGH, 'CAUSE I'M NOT GREAT FRIENDS WITH THESE PEOPLE AT THIS POINT.
- PAULY, CAN WE HAVE THE WHIPPED CREAM? - YOU CAN HAVE WHATEVER YOU WANT, GIRL.
YOU'RE A PARTY.
- YAY.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY SAMMI'S HERE.
SHE'S BORING.
THANK YOU.

SHE'S JUST THERE.
SHE'S LIKE FURNITURE.
[rock music] - DUDE, CAN WE GO? GRAB YOUR KEYS AND STOP YOUR WHINING, BABY - READY? - READY TO GO.

- OH, THAT'S HER PROBLEM.
I'M GONNA WRITE DOWN MY OWN SCHEDULE.
OH.

[slow rock music] - DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW WE FEEL, LIKE, LIVING IN A HOUSE WITH SAM? - I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S HARD.
YOU GUYS LITERALLY JUST GOT INTO PHYSICAL ALTERCATIONS WITH EACH OTHER.
BUT - I FEEL LIKE ME AND JENNI-- WE STILL CARE ABOUT THIS GIRL.

- NO? - NO.
- NOT AT ALL? - NO.
- THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S--THAT'S FINE.

I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO THAT GIRL, SHE HAS NOTHING TO SAY TO ME.
I JUST KNOW THAT KARMA'S A BITCH.
AND IN THE END, SHE'LL GET HERS.
AND, UH, IT'LL SMACK HER IN THE FACE SOONER OR LATER.
- IF SHE GREW BALLS, AND SHE SAID, "LISTEN, I TREATED YOU GUYS LIKE [bleep], I KNOW THAT, BUT I LOVE THIS GUY.
" - WHY, DID YOU GUYS HAVE, LIKE, A BRAWL-OUT IN MIAMI? - HMM! - TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I FEEL REALLY BAD FOR HER.
- SO I FEEL LIKE SHE NEEDS TO STICK WITH RON, BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE GIRLFRIENDS IN THE HOUSE.
YOU NEED GIRLFRIENDS.
YOU CANNOT LAST A COUPLE DAYS WITHOUT GIRLFRIENDS.
YOU NEED SOMEBODY THERE FOR YOU.
- YOU GOING TO BED? - LAYING DOWN FOR A LITTLE BIT.

HI, COULD I HELP YOU? - ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ANYTHING SPECIAL TODAY? - NO, JUST LOOKING.

YOU NEED TO FEED THE MACHINE BEFORE THE MACHINE CAN RUN.
DO YOU GUYS HAVE SIDE POTATOES OR WHATEVER? I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE SITUATION GETTING SOME BACON AND EGG CHEESE SANDWICH, A LITTLE HOME FRIES ON THE SIDE.
THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

LET'S GET THE BROOM.

SO WE TRIED TO GET IT.
I'LL HOLD YOUR LEGS.
YOU WON'T FALL, BOO.
BUT WE'RE BOTH, LIKE, 4'9", SO IT'S NOT WORKING OUT TOO WELL.
- IT'S NOT HAPPENING.
- ARE YOU SURE? I WON'T DROP YOU.
- NO, IT'S NOT LONG ENOUGH.
- A LITTLE HELP, A LITTLE HELP, A LITTLE HELP? - VINNY, YOU HAVE LONGER ARMS.
CAN YOU GET IT? - WHAT ELSE CAN WE ATTACH TO THIS? OUR BALL IS STUCK ON THE OTHER ROOF.
SO I WAS PLAYING MacGYVER.
AND PULLED TOGETHER SOME BASIC HOUSEHOLD JERSEY SHORE AMENITIES AND MAKE A LONG HOSE OUT OF BROOMS AND BEER FUNNELS TO TRY TO GET IT OFF THE ROOF.
IT'S NOT GONNA HOLD.
- I'LL TRY.
- SQUOOSH IT IN.
MAKE IT FIT.
ANYTHING COULD FIT.

- WAIT-- - MAYBE IF WE LICK IT BEFORE WE STICK IT.
SNOOKI! - YOU SAID LICK IT.
- WAIT, WAIT-- - SHE GOT IT! - WOW, THAT WORKED.
THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULDA DONE! OH, IT'S COMING.

AND, LIKE MacGYVER, MISSION SUCCESS.
- YAY! [rock music] - WHERE'S VINNY? - I'M WAITING FOR HIM SO MAYBE WE COULD JUST GO ON THE BOARDWALK.
- I WANNA GO ON THE RIDES DOWN THERE.
- YEAH, YEAH, WHY DON'T WE ALL GO? I'M BEING HONEST, DOG.
DON'T--DON'T BOUNCE WITHOUT-- WITHOUT ME AND VINNY.
- YEAH, NO-NO.
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU GUYS.
- WE'RE ALL STARTING TO BE-- - YOU GUYS--YOU GUYS WERE WALKING AWAY BEFORE, - WE'RE ALL STARTING TO WHISPER, LIKE, LIKE, LITTLE BY LITTLE, LIKE, "YO, RON'S LEAVING US OUT.
" YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, LIKE-- - NO, I KNOW, I KNOW.

MIKE AND VINNY ARE GONNA COME.

- THAT'S FINE.
- WAIT, WHAT ARE WE DOING ON THE BOARDWALK? - WAIT, WHAT? - WHAT? - RONNIE AND SAMMI ARE COMING.
- THAT'S FINE, I DON'T CARE.
- GOOD FOR YOU.
- OH! - YOU READY, BOYS? - THAT MEANS THE WHOLE FAMILY'S COMING.
- REALLY? - I THOUGHT RON AND I ACTUALLY WANTED TO HANG OUT ON OUR OWN.
BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO THE BOARDWALK WITH EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE.
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE HAVING FUN WITH THESE PEOPLE.
- GIRLS, LET'S GET A MOVE ON IT! TRYING TO HIT THE BOARDWALK.
LET'S GO! BOARDWALK TIME! - DO YOU WANT A CIGARETTE? - NO.
[rock music] - I WANNA GO ON THE RIDES! - ME TOO, ME TOO, ME TOO! [hard rock music] THIS IS HOW WE LIVE THIS IS HOW WE LIVE RICH CHANGING, OH - HEY, SNOOKI! IF I DIE, JUST KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU! [screaming] - SO WE ALL DECIDE TO GO ON RIDES.
AND PRETTY MUCH ALL THE ROOMMATES ARE HAVING FUN.
BUT THEN WE LOOK OVER AT SAM, AND SAM'S NOT GOING ON ANY RIDES.
SAM HAS A PUSS FACE ON.
SAM, WHY DID YOU EVEN COME OUT IF YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA HANG OUT WITH US AND HAVE A GOOD TIME? - THIS [bleep] IS CRAZY.
- SHUT UP, I'M NOT-- GET OUT OF HERE, DUDE! - [screaming] - I'LL GO ON THAT ONE NEXT.
RONNIE! I NEED YOUR HELP! WE GOTTA GET HIM OUT HERE, BRO.

I HAVE NOBODY IN THIS HOUSE.
I FEEL LIKE THE GIRL THAT WAS IN MIAMI.
I FEEL SO LOST RIGHT NOW.

- TIGHTEN ME UP.
TIGHT, TIGHT, TIGHT.
TIGHTENED UP, TIGHTENED UP.
- IT'S GONNA PLUNGE! [screams] - GOTTA KEEP YOUR HEAD UP EVEN WHEN YOU'RE FALLING DOWN KEEP YOUR HEAD UP - SAM JUST PISSES ME OFF THAT IT'S LIKE "GO OUT, HAVE A GOOD TIME.
" YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE UP MY ASS.
- YO, VINNY'S SCARED RIGHT NOW.
- FASTER.
- FASTER.
- I FEEL LIKE THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE GUYS-- EVERYTHING IS JUST TWISTED AGAIN LIKE IT WAS IN MIAMI.
- WITH SAM, IT'S LIKE I TAKE ONE STEP FORWARD, THREE STEPS BACKWARDS BECAUSE SAM CAN'T LET GO OF THE PAST.
SHE LET'S STUFF EAT AWAY AT HER, AND THAT'S WHAT'S EATING AWAY AT THIS RELATIONSHIP.
YOU'RE BEING A [bleep] [bleep].
- THE HARDEST THING YOU CAN DO IS LOOK BACK AND SEE WHAT THE PERSON WHO YOU LOVE HAS DONE TO YOU.
NO, DON'T.
I KNOW.
I SHOULDN'T BE CRYING.
- WE'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE THEN, HUH? - I DON'T TRUST RON.
AND IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE IN WHAT HE SAYS TO ME NOW.
AND I'M NOT PROUD OF WHAT I DID AT ALL.
- YOU LIED TO ME FOR THOSE TWO MONTHS IN MIAMI.
LIKE STRAIGHT TO MY FACE.
LIKE IMAGINE IF I EVER DID THA TO YOU.
IMAGINE.
- AT LEAST I CAME HOME TO YOU.
- WHAT? I WOULD RATHER YOU NOT COME IN MY BED AND FOR YOU TO CUT ME OFF THAN DO WHAT YOU DID TO ME.
- I REALIZE IF SHE DID THAT TO ME, I'D PROBABLY BE REALLY [bleep] UP IN THE HEAD TOO.
BUT, I MEAN, IT'S GOTTA GET TO A POINT WHERE IT'S LIKE YOU EITHER GET OVER IT OR YOU MOVE ON.
AND IT'S LIKE IF YOU CAN'T GET OVER IT, THEN YOU JUST GOTTA MOVE ON.
WHY ARE YOU THE ONLY ONE THAT'S ALLOWED TO HURT? I DON'T GET IT.
- I NEVER ONCE DID ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO YOU.
- OKAY.
- I DID NOT HAVE SEX WITH ANYBODY BUT YOU.
- OKAY, SAM.
- HOW COULD YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT? - OKAY, IF YOU WANNA BELIEVE THAT I CONTINUE TO DO IT, THEN BELIEVE IT.
- WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW-- IT'S LIKE I DON'T GET HOW YOU PUT IT ON ME.
- YOU ASKED ME HOW COULD I DO WHAT I DID TO YOU IN MIAMI.
AND MY ANSWER-- - I DON'T DESERVE-- FIRST OF ALL-- - LET ME [bleep] TALK.
YOU JUST [bleep] TALKED.
NOW IT'S MY [bleep] TURN TO TALK, OKAY? - DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.
- OKAY, SO THEN I WON'T TALK TO YOU AT ALL.
- THEN DON'T TALK TO ME.
- HOW 'BOUT THAT? - I DON'T-- I DEFINITELY DON'T DESERVE TO BE TALKED TO THE WAY YOU'RE TALKING TO ME RIGHT NOW.
- WELL, YOU ASKED ME FOR A QUESTION, I GOT YOUR ANSWER.
IF YOU DON'T LIKE MY [bleep] ANSWER, DON'T ASK THE QUESTION.
- HOW COULD I LOVE A GUY THAT DISRESPECTS ME SO MUCH? - SLEEP WELL.
HERE WE GO MIAMI ALL OVER AGAIN.
I'M SICK.
I'M SICK.
- ALL I REALLY WANNA KNOW IS THIS THE LAST-- IS THIS THE LAST TIME IS THIS THE LAST TIME ALL I REALLY WANNA KNOW IS THIS THE LAST-- IS THIS THE LAST TIME IS THIS THE LAST TIME ALL I REALLY WANNA KNOW IS THIS THE LAST-- IS THIS THE LAST TIME IS THIS THE LAST TIME THAT YOU SHOW TELL ME IF IT'S TIME TO GO - SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD TIME.
- I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY AND I'M SORRY.
IT HAD TO COME OUT, SO I TOLD HER HOW I FELT.
- DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG I'VE WAITED FOR THAT? OH! MY VAGINA'S OUT.
[scream] - NICOLE IS SMASHED RIGHT NOW.
CAN YOU GRAB MY PURSE? LET'S GO.
I DON'T NEED YOU TO GET ARRESTED FOR THIS [bleep].
NICOLE! - I'M A GOOD PERSON.
- From me! From me! - Come here.
Come here.
- Yo! Stop! - Ding ding ding, round two.
- Get off, vinny! Get off! - We still care about this girl, and the fact that she - No.
- You don't? - Nah.
- No? - No.
- Vinny locked the door.
- So who are you stuck with? - I'm stuck with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
- Or me.
- [Laughs] I'm all right.
- Let me [Bleep] Talk.
You just [Bleep] Talked.
Now it's my [Bleep] Turn to talk, okay? - Don't talk to me like that.
- [Kiss] Sleep well.
[Get crazy by lmfao] - Dj pauly delvecchio! - I'm going to the Jersey shore, bitch! - All right, we got a situation.
- I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
- [Laughing] - After I have sex with a guy, I will rip their heads off.
- Go vinny! Go vinny! - Um, hello! - If you wanna have fun and do something crazy [somber music] - now I'm talking to you and you don't want to talk, so, like, I didn't do anything wrong.
Why am I going out of my way to talk to you? Why are you running? I shouldn't be chasing you.
I'm mentally [Bleep]Ed up right now.
- Okay, welcome to my world.
The way you feel right now, I felt for three weeks before Miami.
- You should have been a man and [Bleep] Owned up to your [Bleep], instead of leading me on like you did.
I feel like I owe, like, snooki an apology, 'cause I cut her out of my life.
I believed you and everything you were saying, 'cause I was blinded by being so in love with you.
- So then go.
Go fix your friendship with snooki, go fix your friendship with [Bleep] Jenni, and we're done with.
- I feel stupid for hating jenni and Nicole so much for things that happened way back when.
Like, I need to move on.
It's not about Ron.
It's about myself, and me and the girls.
[Rock music] - Wow.
[Laughing] - I want to eat this potato.
- By itself? Since I got to the shore, I can't remember the last time I seen Nicole sober.
It's been a while.
Oh, my God.
- That's not bad.
That's not bad.
That's not bad.
- "That's not bad.
That's not bad.
" - Oh, say you were [Bleep] Stuck in the cornfields and you gotta eat it.
- It's corn.
- That's not bad.
- That's not [laughing] - Hey, blast any gas? - Not supposed to eat a potato like that.
- It was good, though.
- Was it? What? What? Play with you? - Mm-hmm.
- Snooki.
We have this thing with snooki that when she drinks, you don't know what's gonna come out of her mouth.
- Boing boing.
Tonight, I definitely want to touch [Bleep], and why not vinny's, because it's, like, nice? - What its name.
- Seabiscuit.
- Seabiscuit? Snooki.
She's begging for seabiscuit, like, literally, literally begging.
A lot of guys might think I'm crazy for not wanting to.
Oh, dear.
- Right in here! Please.
I want to be with you.
- Come on, let's go find the girls.
- No.
- I don't want to take advantage of snooki when she's incoherent.
- Whatever.
I'm over it.
Yeah, good-bye.
[Rock music] - yo, Mike, dance with me! Mike, come dance with me! I know that deena wants to make out with Mike, but she doesn't want to be too forward about it, so you know me.
I break the ice.
Threesome! Can we have a threesome? - Yeah.
- I'm so [Bleep] Horny.
- Sounds like a good time.
What bed do we do it in? - I like Mike.
I think he has a sick body, he has a cute face, but, basically, his personality and how he carries himself.
- You always want to stay protected.
You know what I'm saying? Every guy has a dream of having a threesome with two women, obviously.
Maybe not deena and snooks, but, um, I was going along with it only because it was a threesome.
You know what I'm saying? All right, let's do it.
Oh, my.
You see what's going on here? All of a sudden, snooks sneaks out of the bed, and I'm left with deena.
That's like having chicken put on the table with salt and pepper, and then somebody takes away the chicken, and then they left you with salt and pepper.
Did you shower? - You know, "vinny, can I come in? Vinny, you want to cuddle?" Never really have I had this happen to me.
I'm a little upset about this.
But at the same time, like, you never really say to stop it.
- [Giggling] - I'm ready to go, but that's when I start kind of smelling the alcohol.
Like, right away, it's like, yeew, you know? - Vinny, you can trust me.
Oh, God.
Seriously? Really? He always does that to me, but he [Bleep]Ed Angelina.
- That's true.
He cares about you, that's why.
- Well, stop caring and [Bleep] Me, man.
I'm not tired.
I like this shirt.
It's cool and everything.
- It is actually.
It is cool.
I was looking for that threesome.
It turned into just the You know, the d-some.
- I don't want to go work some more.
- Okay.
- I like, like, to snuggle.
- [Moans] - I think now I'm tired.
Do you want a massage? - Just relax and enjoy yourself.
- How many girls have you even slept with? - Oh, my God.
We are talking.
I mean, sometimes the only way to shut up a girl is to sYou know.
I kissed her, and I had no I was not horny.
I was just so not into it.
I think it's a miracle that she's getting up out of my bed right now, walking to the bathroom.
I invented the kitchen ditchin'.
Because to get out of the situation I was in, I had to ditch and go straight to the kitchen.
I knew exactly how to get out of it.
Peace out.
- My ass is burning.
I need relief asap, because it does not feel good.
- Are you itching it on something? - I'm in the fridge.
Where's the beach? - Nicole! - Ew, get the [Bleep] Off my arm before I [Bleep] - You're talking to a police officer like that.
[Handcuffs click] - I'm a [Bleep] Good person.
[The whigs' hundred/million] Shock me into town everybody wants to take me down white light in my brain if they want to - I'm going to the gym.
Want to come, snook? - Yeah.
I need to drop my laundry off, too.
- Let's do it.
We can go tanning on the way home.
- I'm doing g.
T.
L.
Right now.
- So proud.
[Laughs] - Gym, tan, laundry.
Gym, tan, laundry.
- Whoa! God! [Screams] - Do you have spray paint? 'Cause she's trying to come out darker than me.
- You like to [Bleep]? Oh, yeah.
- Come on, girl, look at that.
- Look at that.
- It's like jungle fever.
- I think pauly's really black, like, seriously, because when he tans, he's black.
- It sucks being the, um Not the tannest in the house.
- I'm leaving.
- You're fine with Sam.
I'm not.
- What's it gonna be like, though? - Me, if she, like, apologizes, and she's, like, okay, I was wrong, then I'd be okay with it.
Jenni was like, if Sam talks to me, I'm not gonna give her the time of day.
Boo? My ass is burning.
Oh, my God, I'm so itchy.
Ow! I wanted to get, like, really, really dark, so I decided to use lotion.
I put a glob on my ass.
So itchy, it's on fire, and I needed relieve asap, because it does not feel good.
Oh, my God, someone needs to kiss my ass asap.
Booey, kiss my ass.
Oh, we got a fridge.
This feels good.
- Are you itching it on something? - I'm in the fridge.
- [Laughs] - [Laughs] Boo-boo.
My butt feels better.
I have to poop.
- Waking up today, I'm not okay.
I think I need to do something to get over Miami, because it's been ruining me.
I think, like, automatically, if Ron's going out somewhere, he's doing something to hurt me, like lying and cheating again.
- Sleeping? - I make myself believe it's happening, and I make myself go crazy.
- What's going on? - You tell me what's going on.
Please tell me the truth.
- About what? - Look me in the face and all the skeletons lay out right now, because I know.

- What the [Bleep] Did I do, Mike? Have I done anything? What the [Bleep] Have I done? - Living with Ron and Sam in the same room, it's just not a good situation.
Honest, dude, I can't even talk about this.
It's not even cool anymore.
It's horrible, these two.
Just break the [Bleep] Up and call it a day.
- Get the [Bleep] Up and let's go outside.
I don't understand.
Enlighten me, please.
Apparently, I'm getting accused for [Bleep] That I didn't do, so I need a mind condom, because I'm being mind-[Bleep]Ed.
What have I done? Please tell me what I've done.
I would love to know what the [Bleep] You think you know about what I've done since I've been home from Miami.
There's nothing I've done to you! [Bleep] Nothing! [Bleep] Nothing I've done to you.
- I'm gonna be real.
It's her.
I'm gonna be real, it's her.
Even if it was his fault and he [Bleep]Ed up in Miami, she needs to be a woman and be like, "[Bleep] You.
I'm gonna be by myself," and then ther - Not just - Yeah, and, therefore, if that had happened, you'll see him do his thing, have fun, and then you'll see her try to grow as a person and try to have some fun, which she's never had.
- She's not the type to let loose, and that's it.
- I finished, okay? I didn't [Bleep]In' do a god[Bleep] Thing! - Listen, I have a feeling that you're doing something to me again.
- What have I done? - You tell me.
I don't know if he's a changed person.
I don't know if I trust him.
I don't know if I believe him.
I don't know what to do right now.
- Okay, so what did I do? Tell me! - Tell me! I don't know! - Please, what the [Bleep] Have I done? - Yeah, that's him? - What you want? [Bleep] You and [Bleep] Believe whoever the [Bleep] You want.

- I'm sorry, too.
- You want to be friends with her, go right ahead.
Do I? [Bleep] Her.

- Same bull[Bleep], different day.
- Time to go to the gym.
You ready? - Yeah, let's go.
- All right, let's go.
- I don't know what it is.
I guess, whatever happened in Miami.
You know, we had issues, and she's bringing it into this house, and I'm getting tired of it.
I just need to clear my head.
- Like, don't get me wrong.
I'm sure you care for the girl, but she's definitely bringing you down.
- She's not the same person that I met [Bleep] Last year.
- Yep, that It happens, dude.
- But you know, like, I love her, I want to be with her.
I want to be with that kind of girl.
- You want to be with that person that you knew.
This may not be that girl, you know what I mean? Take it out on the gym right now.
You know what I'm saying? - One more.
- Sam accused me of [Bleep] Around, but I didn't do anything.
I haven't done anything since Miami.
- Three.
- To be honest with you, I don't need to deal with this [Bleep].
She's a grown woman.
She can make her own decision.
She should have [Bleep] Pushed me away.
- One shot, come on! - It's like, why am I dealing with Sam's drama? - Good upper cut.
- It's mind-boggling.
- I don't want to go to work.
- Neither do I.
I really don't.
I'm not into it today.
"Um, can you help me pick out something for my shirt? What should I get?" What the [Bleep] You think you should get? What the hell do I look like? [Bleep] Dj.
- [Laughs] - Samantha! Get your ass down here! We gotta go to work! - Tootles.
- See you guys.
The guidos are here! - All right Sammi sweetheart, Nicole, I got a little job for you girls.
- Two and one, right? - Yeah, exactly.
You've done this before.
- Yep.
- I don't want to work with Sam.
It's not a fun time.
- Bang those out, girls.
- Well, this is boring.
- I didn't know if I wanted to really apologize on Nicole in the workplace but, um, it had to come out.
I owed Nicole an apology, so I told her how I felt.
I owe you an apology, and I am sorry for cutting our friendship completely, and it's disgusting I didn't believe the right thing, but I am so wrong, and you were so right the whole time, and just thank you for going on your For doing something.
- Do you know how long I've waited for that? I just wanted to - When you're in love, sometimes you don't want to see the bad, and you don't want to believe it.
- You needed to know.
And even when you did know, you didn't do anything.
- And now I don't know what to do.
- You're gonna stay with this guy? That's not okay.
- No, it's not okay.
No matter what, you can talk to me.
- Thank you.
- I wouldn't see myself really accepting an apology, because I would have been like, "[Bleep] You.
" Like, it shows how good of a person Nicole is.
I thought you were out to get me and you weren't.
- And I was I was being friends to you.
- You were a friend.
- And I'm like, "oh, my God, this bitch is so mean.
" - I was mean.
- That's okay.
I'm sorry, too.
- Hug.
- Nah! Oh, my God, bitch, you're such a whore.
Why were you like that? - I don't know.
- Oh, my goodness! Girl talk! I don't think a male should have to witness that.
Aw, you know what's cool? You guys walk together now.
- Yeah! - Aww! - How was your day? I call you.
- Right.
- Me and tom are on rocky conditions right now.
I forgot my anniversary, so the conversation isn't really going well.
All right.
Well, call me when you're not a [Bleep].
Good-bye.
Joking or not, he's still being a jerk-off, so I'm taking it as that I'm gonna do me and have a good time down in Jersey.
[Bleep] Idiot.
- Thank you, Nicole.
- You're going out tonight, right? - Yeah, I hope.
Now, like, you know, like, it's not gonna be awkward.
Let's move on from it, hopefully.
So at first, I didn't give deena, like, a chance at all.
Deena.
- Yeah? - Sorry.
Come here.
But, um, it feels good talking to Nicole, so why not talk to deena now? Maybe I'll feel even better.
It's okay, it's all right.
Here, sit.
- I'll let you girls be to yourselves, 'cause I can't hear this [Bleep] Again.
[Laughing] - Okay, let me tell you where I'm coming from.
- Yeah.
- Coming to this house and knowing that I'm not really great friends with Nicole and jwoww, knowing that you're friends with Nicole, so I felt very, like, on my own and defensive.
- No, I know.
- Can I just say, like, I think when I first came in the house, like - [Burps] - No matter what, like, whatever relationship I have with you is not with jenni, it's not with Nicole, it's with yourself.
That's all I can ask for, and, like, um, first thing, it's squashed.
- All right, it's done.
It's erased.
- So, let's move forward.
- Erased.
- And that's it.
- We'll drink patron tonight and have a good time.
- Yes.
- I'm really happy that we worked things out, but the only thing I'm worried about is, like, the whole jenni and Sammi thing, 'cause jenni is like, she's my girl.
You brought me into this house, and jenni has had my back since day one.
- It will never be okay with jenni and Sam ever.
It won't.
I feel kind of bad, like, being friends with Sammi now.
Jenni, come here, please.
So I need to talk to jenni.
So, I talked to Sam at work.
She's like, "we had good times and I [Bleep]Ed it up," and she apologized for everything.
- She didn't apologize to me.
- She's I think she's scared to talk to you.
- I would be, too.
It's too late.
There's no possible way in hell that I would ever be friends with Sam again.
So you want to be friends with her, go right ahead.
Do I? [Bleep] Her.
- Get out, get down while you're feelin' the jams come on, move on we're leading you on, yeah [girl laughs] - I want to get on that stage, I want to dance, I want to, you know, do what I have to do.
[Electronic dance music] - To smushing tonight.
- To smushing.
- Oh, my vagina's out.
[Screams] Everything kind of just went blank.
- Where is she going? Nicole! - Where's the beach? [Percussion and bass] - it's almost t-shirt time, br.
- Yo, I'm calling the cab.
- Where you goin'? - I'm going to karma.
- Give us about a half-hour.
- Thank you, sir.
- You got it.
- You have a half-hour.
Half-hour.
Half-hour.
- I'm breakin' out the new fist-pump tonight.
- I love how they look so much bigger.
- Your boobs look [Bleep] Phenomenal.
- Phenomenal.
- [Laughs] - What a good time.
- Yo, my prediction is somebody needs to carry her out of the club tonight.
- Listen, you don't know me.
I'm gonna go in there, I'm gonna dance.
I'm not drinking at the club.
[Electronic dance music] - I'm walking into karma, the first person that I see is Roger.
Roger is an old friend of mine.
We had something in the past a long time ago, but, you know, as of right now, we're still friends.
- Here we go she dance at the party and she's always in the light - dancing is my best thing.
I don't care if people look at me [Bleep] Funny.
I just love to dance, and get off of me.
- This is out of control - and I know, oh-oh she's a superstar, and it shows oh-oh, this is out of control and I know oh-oh, she's a superstar-star-star - did deena really just fall off the yeah.
I fell off the [Bleep]In' stage.
- What's goin' on feelin' your heart in my patron - deena calls herself the holiday, and I like to call her the holiday inn.
So 6 minutes and 53 seconds into karma, uh, the holiday inn closed early tonight.
- She's outta control - we knew that was gonna happen.
She's getting crazy.
She's getting crazy, bro.
[Dance music] - Paula is the cute girl that I had met down in seaside last year.
We were in the jacuzzi together doing what, what, or whatever, and then she kind of forgot she had legs.
That girl is something else.
We just got chemistry, and, uh, we're not talking about the class.
[screams] - Snooki is really drunk right now.
And I'm trying to tell her, like, she should tone it down a little bit.
But she's being really, really extremely stubborn, and she's kind of a mess.
- Ow.
- Roger kind of looks like a big juice monkey, yet he is polite, respectful, which is shocking.
I definitely think me and Roger have feelings for each other, but really can't express them because I still have tom.
My friends Lauren's telling me that Roger has a girlfriend that works at the tanning salon.
Lauren's the one that came to the house back in Jersey last year to get Paula.
- You missed your first day at work.
Your mom's hysterical, doesn't know what the [Bleep] Happened to you.
Go get your [Bleep], let's go.
I told your mom I wasn't leaving without you.
- Really? Like, come on, dude.
I don't care if Roger was hooking up with someone from the tanning salon, but I don't like liars.
Upstairs at karma, there's no bathrooms.
- No one's looking at you.
- Stop it! - Oh! Oh! - What the [Bleep] Was that? [Upbeat music] - No, cool it.
It's like if you've been lying to me on the first day of me seeing you again, like, then you can just lie for the rest of your life.
I walk away.
I just want to have fun at this point.
- Hey! - So me and Nicole go upstairs where it's closed off.
Decide to have our own nightclub up there, just me and her.
- Let's have a sexy party nose jobs and champagne let's have a sexy party mink, razors, so vain let's have a sexy party - [Both scream] - Rock stars are so lame sounds like I'll hate that party - I did.
- Upstairs at karma, there's no bathrooms, and there's, like, I had huge heels on, and if you're like myself, you can't make it downstairs, you make your own bathroom.
Don't tell anybody! - No one's looking at you! - Stop it! - Seriously, like, who pees in the bar? Oh, God.
Shh.
So embarrassing.
Oh, look at Ron and Sam making up.
Vomit.
- Go pff.
Go pff.
Pff.
[Laughing] Obviously us together is unhealthy, but some relationships, like, unhealthy makes them grow stronger, so maybe, hopefully, you know, we're gonna make it through together.
- Whether we fight or not, we do have this connection that I don't think anybody will ever understand.
Maybe we're not meant to be in a relationship, but I think that we can, you know, make it work.
- Come here, you [Bleep] Ass[Bleep].
- Last summer, when I met Danielle, she turned into a psycho stalker.
- Bye.
You stalked my whole entire life, right? And I don't like that.
If you weren't such a [] Stalker, I would have called you when I got home.
[Dial tone] - [Laughs] - She still worries me, that girl.
- You going to the bathroom? - Yeah, bro.
- Bye, guys.
- Yo, we'll be back.
We'll be back.

- At first, I thought it was a guy, but then when I seen it was Danielle.
Get her out of here! Get the [Bleep] Outta here! Get outta here.
- I got it, I got it.
I don't know why Danielle the stalker threw a drink at me.
I haven't talked to this girl in a year.
To throw a drink in my face? Me, of all people? [Microphone thuds] - I don't want to be the bitch, but you have to go.
- No, I won't.
- At this point, I'm really worried that Nicole's gonna get arrested.
- You are not cool.
Get the [Bleep] Off.

- [Laughing] - Like, you're cooking at 4:30 in the morning, and you're laughing.
- [Snickering] - Ronnie has two different kinds of laughs.
One laugh is a soft little girl laugh, where he's like, [high-pitched] T-ha ha ha ha ha! - [High-pitched laugh] - Then Ronnie has another big laugh where he sounds like a dolphin on steroids, where it goes, ta-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
- [Laughing] - Feels really good to be kickin' it with Ron, 'cause, like, Ron has been through a lot with Sam, and at the end of the day, I just want my boy to be happy.

We're just really hurting.
- I keep getting camel toe, I feel.
- Is this more? [Gasps] Yeah, it is.
Right from work, I went to the bar.
You know what's a good time? Taking a shot off your wife.
- Uh-oh! - Old people, they lose their sex life, and that's not a fun time.
That's why people always get divorced.
You lick this, take the shot, and then take it out of her mouth.
Oh, hell, yeah! You two are totally banging tonight.
I think I should be a sex therapist.
Oh, my God! - I got kicked out of the club last night.
- Aah! - Nicole is smashed right now.
She's on, like, a 24 hour binger.

There's no controlling that 4'9" girl.
She's like a 3,000-pound man.
She's like a bulldozer.
Oh, dear Jesus.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna fall.
- Just afraid she's gonna turn around and run to the beach again.
- No, you're psycho.

Whoa! Can you grab my purse? Let's go.
I don't need you to get arrested for this [Bleep].
I'm a good person.
[Get crazy by lmfao] Dj pauly delvecchio! I'm going to the Jersey shore, bitch! All right, we got a situation.
I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
[Laughing] After I have sex with a guy, I will rip their heads off.
Go vinny! Go vinny! Um, hello! If you wanna have fun and do something crazy [police radio chatter, handcuffs tighten] I need to call her dad before he finds out from someone else.
What is it called? Drunken indecency? - Drunken - Intoxication in the public? Drunken public intoxication? Hi, is this snook's dad? Hi, Mr.
polizzi, it's jwoww.
Nicole just got arrested for public intoxication.
Oh, [Bleep].
Okay.
All right, call me, jwoww, as soon as you pick her up and get her.
Okay, and I'll try and have her call you, but if not, I'll still call you back when I pick her up.
All right, honey, thank you.
No problem.
Bye.
- Yeah, bye-bye.
[Dials] [Phone rings] - Hello? - Hi.
Hi.
I apologize for not calling.
[Sniffs] Okay.
Why? They just arrested Nicole.
For what? For being drunk and an idiot.
So she got arrested today.
Okay, so then what the [Bleep] Happened last night? No [Bleep].
I get [indistinct] in a [bleep] phone call.
I knew that was gonna happen.
That's why I didn't want to [Bleep] Call him.
Tom not caring about Nicole and him yelling at me, it's showing a side of Tom that I don't like and a side that I've never seen before, and that really pisses me off.
Don't think that me not calling the night before is priority over Nicole being arrested right now.
What happened? Nicole was bombed.
They find her on the beach, completely belligerent.
We couldn't get her off the beach.
Like, it was embarrassing.
- Where is she? - At the jail.
We have to go get her.
She got arrested.
Hello? Hi.
- Go [Bleep] Yourself! - Yo, listen it's not funny anymore.
She has a problem.
She went to work in her dress from last night.
[Phone quacking] And slippers.
Hello? Are you calmed down yet? No.
- O-okay.
Well, listen.
You got something to deal with right now.
I don't have anything to deal with.
You're being a jerk-off.
I didn't call you one night.
Big [Bleep] Whoop! - Okay, so you couldn't do a four-second phone call? Like, who are you? What do you mean who am I? [Bleep] You.
You [Call waiting beeps] - Hello.
- Hi, is jenni there? This is she.
Hey, um, you can come and pick her up.
The lieutenant advised that we can release her.
Thank you so much.
- Free snooki! Free snooki! - Yay! Can't somebody help me now to break me out of my cell I need your touch to get me out of this hell only your love can break me out of my shell 'cause only you have the key to get me out of this jail I just hope ja um, like, prison time didn't change you, girl.
Oh, I'm "g" now.
Don't [Bleep] With me.
A little bit, girl.
- I did.
- Go, girl.
Yay.
I'm saved.
Going to jail is definitely embarrassing, but the fact that I have these people in the house that are supporting me and they're here for me, that makes me feel, like, We have her back.
Thank God.
I'm embarrassed.
Why did I get arrested? I don't understand.
You were a public nuisance.
You were being a nuisance.
Why? Because you were rolling around in the sand, jumping in the water.
Was I screaming? Oh, this is a bad situation.
Oh, oh! [Mumbling] Get off me.
Get off.
Get the [Bleep] Off.
Yeah, that'll do it.
The state of new Jersey versus Nicole polizzi.
My dad's gonna should I call him? Don't call dad.
My dad is your typical Italian, crazy-ass, psycho dad.
My dad's gonna [Bleep] Kill me, man.
I know he's gonna give me the rundown.
Dad? Yes.
Oh, my God.
I got arrested, dad.
I know.
I couldn't even tell you how I felt in that jail cell.
It was like a [Bleep] Phenomenon.
Oh, not a phenomenon.
A [Bleep] Train wreck.
It wasn't fun.
You need to understand what you're doing to yourself and your body, and you should not put yourself in that position, Nicole.
It's not like I killed someone.
Listen, you should bury your head in the sand with embarrassment.
All right, well get your [Bleep] Together, girl.
Okay.
I swear on my father, nic, the next time, I will get in the truck and come down and [Bleep] Kick your ass out, and it will be done.
And I mean [Bleep] Done.
Do you understand me? Please don't be mad.
Nic, it's not a question of being mad at you.
I'm disappointed.
I'm upset.
Really? The worst thing a parent can say to their child is "I'm not mad at you, I'm not upset with you, but I'm disappointed in you.
" Promise yourself that you'll never put yourself in that position again.
Love you.
All right.
I love you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, my God.
He's freaking out, man.
That's a father for you.
"I'm disappointed in you.
" That's like [Blows raspberry] That word "disappoint" really [Bleep] Hurts the heart.
After what my dad said, I need to be smart about this.
I can't go out again, because if I do I'm gonna get drunk, wasted, and probably end up back in jail.
So, you know, I'm just gonna relax tonight and sleep.
I'm exhausted.
[Laughter] Let me show you.
[Laughter] She has sand [Bleep].
Sandy [Bleep].
Sandy [Bleep].
Here.
You want to rock? Eh, nah.
Girls need that girl time to sit down and just let everything out that's on your mind, because then you'll feel so much better.
You know what real you know what I think it is? [Bleep] Emilio.
Because after all that [Bleep] Went down in Miami, I was never an angry drunk.
Well, I was, but I wasn't that bad.
Do you want me to be blatantly honest? Yeah.
I think you need to find love.
And you'll try and find it in anyone.
And, like, you'll make guys that aren't good enough for you good enough for you.
You set yourself up for disaster.
Yeah.
Happens to all of us.
- But I'm, like, bad with it.
- I know.
It's kind of like a disease to snook for love.
It's worse than a staph infection.
It just keeps eating at you and eating at you, and then when you don't find a guy, you just get more miserable and more depressed, and it's just not a good time.
This is the things I think I'm addicted to.
Bronzer, boys, and alcohol.
You're not, though.
Can we please have these therapy sessions? - Yeah.
- At least once a week? I'm [Bleep]Ed up.
Are you kidding me? This guy looks he's, like, Ronnie's twin.
Yo, yo, go like this.
Go like this.
Oh, my God! See anybody you know down there? - Yeah.
- Who? My friend Roger.
Yo, Roger that.
R r Roger that.
[Cheers and applause] Catch me when I walk in I'm the flyest thing walking then I open up my mouth cabs are here.
Mike, vinny, and pauly love girls, and when I'm drunk, I seem to love girls, so I think I'm definitely gonna be the wingman of tonight.
The cabs are here! Cab's here.
Let's do it.
You know who we are you know who we are we are the stars pretty ballsy move, coming out with the boys.
Yeah, it's definitely ballsy.
Got a lot of balls, girl.
As we're entering bamboo, it is insane.
There's there's a mass amount of people everywhere.
Oh, pretty girls.
Grenades, landmines.
Everybody's there, and it's time to have a good time.
Got me floating, got me going hypnotized while I'm on the floor that's her favorite position.
Yeah! And then you have to kiss me after.
[Cheering] When we're rolling mvp, we don't want anybody else rolling with us really, but on the other hand, Dina, she has a nice attitude.
She never [Bleep] Blocks.
She never hates on us.
She does her own thing, and she's a good time.
We like hanging with her.
So she's welcome to hang with mvp whenever she wants.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mvpd.
Mvpd.
Thank you.
You want to come with me over there? I meet this guy, his name is dean, and I'm thinking to myself, perfect size, nice teeth, good muscles.
This kid's frickin' hot.
Got the little faux hawk.
I love it.
No, you don't get it.
Faux hawk is, like, my best thing.
Is it? Dina's dancing with a dude.
We're like, "are you kidding me?" This guy looks exactly like Ronnie.
From afar, from the profile, from everything.
He looks he's, like, Ronnie's twin.
What's up, Ron? How you doing, man? This guy definitely looks like Ronnie's stunt double.
Dina, uh, you know, possibly could be fulfilling some of her fantasies, deep down fantasies for Ronnie by hooking up with the Ronnie look-alike.
Yo, he dances like Ronnie too.
I know.
What the [Bleep]? I'm telling Sam.
I'm telling Sam.
You're, like, my perfect guy.
You want to go home? I'll go back to the house.
I don't care.
- We'll go in the hot tub.
- Whatever you want.
Yay! Bye.
Yo, Ronnie, wait for me, man.
Yo, Ronnie.
Wait for me, Ronnie.
Ron.
Ron, you been working out your traps, bro? So all the boys are hanging out.
We got vinny, Mike, pauly, Ronnie.
Go like this.
Go like this.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yeah, Ronnie, come here, bro.
Come on, Ronnie.
I wanted to bring fake Ronnie into Ronnie and Sam's bedroom, slide in the fake Ronnie stunt double, and see if Sam realizes that it's a fake Ronnie.
Yo, can can we show you something, Sam? Sammi, look.
Sammi, I have your boyfriend right here.
Sammi, look.
Ronnie's stunt double.
Ronnie could, like, bounce for a while and just keep him here at the house.
[Laughter] - What's up, brother? - What's up, man? [Laughter] They know each other! Yo, look at them, bro.
Yeah, my girl oh, you serious? Yeah.
Oh, that's crazy.
His girlfriend's name is Sam.
Oh, that's so crazy.
Sam, I'm gonna borrow Ronnie for a little bit, all right? [Laughter] Having a clone Ronnie is pretty cool.
We got, like, the best of both worlds.
We got to hang out with Ronnie while he's with Sam.
Dude, you're getting with Dina tonight? Dude, you're cheating on Sammi? No, what are you gonna do, bro? Like, it happens, man.
What do you want me to do? Can we go? Go where? - Want to go play? - Yeah.
Okay.
Have fun.
I'm excited, because I finally have a hot juice box back to the house, and I'm going to get him in the hot tub.
You're, like, my perfect guy.
Really? Like, why? Like, what's up? Faux hawk, nice teeth.
Good personality.
You got a girlfriend? Right now, no.
Not at all.
I mean, not really, like Yeah, well, you just gave the "eh.
" Eh, nah.
For real.
No, do you have a girlfriend? You can tell me.
No, honest.
I swear to God.
Not at all.
Just don't tell me now if you have a girlfriend.
Listen, I am single as they come.
All right.
For real.
And if I did have a girl, I wouldn't be here right now with you.
You're so cute.
Sad thing is, like, he'll be back with Sam tomorrow.
- Right after this, you know.
- I know.
How does she just, like, do that to Sammi? Yeah, I know.
After they just made up.
What do we do? Like, should we tell Sam? Wait, I have an idea.
Why don't we write an anonymous note? Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Let's do it.
We'll write it so they won't even think it's us.
We'll write it politically correct, so bring a thesaurus.
- Right.
- "Dear Sam Ronnie hooked up with Dina in the hot tub.
" "In lieu of" "In lieu of Resulting in "Ending up in the bed with you.
For the most part.
" - Right.
- "The third party.
" "You know what I mean.
" "You know what I mean.
" Don't tell her we wrote it.
Oh, I'm not gonna tell her, bro.
But she needs to know.
It's girl code.
Okay, boo boo? We'll do it, boo boo.
- I like to snuggle.
- Yeah? Come with you? Yeah.
Basically, I hit a home run.
I found a guy that I think is hot, my type, and the boys loved him, so I was like, "score.
" Dean definitely didn't get the golden ticket, but, you know, I gave him a sneak peek.
What girls, what girls like about boys what girls, what girls like about boys what girls, what girls like about boys everything Do you have to leave? All right, 'cause we have to leave for work.
All right, I'm gonna go now too.
- All right.
- Bye.
See you later.
All right.
I'll call you.
Definitely.
What a night, man.
That kid stayed with you? - Mm-hmm.
He slept with you? We cuddled.
I think he has a girl I've seen his girlfriend, like, five times.
- He has a girlfriend? - Yeah.
Really? Men are pigs.
He kissed [Bleep] Last night, so - Whatever.
- Whatever.
Sorry, girlfriend.
I didn't even touch him.
That's how you roll, girl.
Tom, next time your girlfriend calls you, why don't you ask her who she was with at karma behind your back? She's just a shady bitch.
I love you.
[Click, dial tone] That's why I'm leaving you.
Douche.
How you doing? Um, I was wondering if I can get a cab for eight people at 11:00? All right, thank you.
Not now but right now Yo, I'm looking fresh, dog.
[Exhales] Let's go.
- One drink.
- Cheers.
Going to the clubs for the first time after I got arrested, it was actually a really good time, because I had, like, a head on my shoulders when I was drinking.
See, Miami is it's a ton of tourists.
There was nobody that were really kind of, like, like us over there, so now it's, like, almost Jersey's like us coming home.
It's everybody that parties out in Jersey are just like us.
You're just fist pumping the night away.
And I like to drink drink, drink, drink I like to drink, drink, drink I like to drink Everyone in general is having fun.
We're all drinking, we're all having a good time.
And I see Roger again, and I'm just kind of like, "let's sit on the couch and break down the last 72 hours.
" Oh.
But the answer I got was, "I think it's not him," so I still have not been verified.
I could tell on Lauren's face that she didn't want to admit that she was wrong, but it's nice to get all the beef squashed, and, you know, I just want to kind of start fresh with Roger and see where it goes.
[Laughter] Yo.
Look at my situation, bro.
Look at my everything right now in the house is going really well.
Ronnie and Sam are not fighting, and it's almost like an avalanche of good energy.
[Phone quacking] Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
What's going on? I just got home.
Oh, yeah? What are you doing? I couldn't really sleep.
Wanted to see if you were home yet.
Oh.
So how was your night? It was fine.
- She's with her ex-boyfriend and then calls her boyfriend, but I'm the dirt bag? Come on, bro.
Bro, I'm telling you, bro.
They're in their own world.
Calling the kettle black, dog? It's kind of funny, because jenni likes to be in other people's business, like she was in Miami.
That man's putting his [Bleep] In other [Bleep].
She's lucky I don't go write Tom a note and be like, "Tom, next time your girlfriend calls you, "why don't you ask her who she was with at karma behind your back?" She's just a shady bitch.
Is there a reason why you're being so short? I think we should just have this conversation tomorrow.
I'm right here.
I'm not a bitch, dude.
- Let's - Yeah, sure.
- Everything's fine.
- Okay.
And I love you, and I'll call you in the morning.
- All right.
- Is that okay? - Yup.
- I love you.
[Click, dial tone] Douche.
We're here with the famous jwoww boobs.
Who works you better, the gorillas or Tom? [Laughter] Oh, my God.
So you wear a hard hat? Yeah, could wear a hard hat With your shirt off and, like, blue jeans? Oh, my God.
This is, like, what I've been waiting for my entire life.
Your picture I saw here I can't get you out of my mind can't get it out of my mind What's up? Hey, it's jenni.
Hey, what are you doing? Nothing, but I'm actually with Alex right now.
We're at the on the boardwalk.
We're down at the other end.
Yeah, we were actually gonna go on the boardwalk, me and "d".
Why don't you hit me up, give a call, like, when you leave there, - and we'll meet you somewhere? - All right.
Okay.
See you there.
Roger and Alex.
Yay.
[Laughter] Cute.
I think I have, like, those high school feelings for Roger? But, you know, I still have reservations, because I am with Tom, but it is nice to talk to another guy.
[Phone quacks] Hello.
Hey, is jenni there? Uh, yeah, hold on one second.
Jenni? - Yeah? - Telephone.
Hello? - Hello.
- Hey.
Hi.
What's going on? Nothing.
I'm gonna go get a coffee with "d" on the boardwalk.
I'm not gonna say anything about Roger to Tom unless it goes further, because as of right now me and Roger are friends and we're just having a good time.
- Bye.
- Love you.
I'm gonna see where I go with Roger, and I'm gonna wait and see if it gets better with Tom.
Bye, pauly.
- Guys, be careful.
- All right.
I was sitting in on new year's Eve and my life was feeling pretty untidy I miss my other meatball.
I call her and Nicole my meatballs.
Your little meatballs? I like it.
I've been called a meatball before.
[Laughs] Have you? Yeah.
Yes, I loved you when I was at school but I never took the chance of writing I'll never fall in love again aah! I want to hear Alex in here.
Shut up.
Ugh.
I got to, like, mentally prepare myself for this one.
I know.
You wouldn't think I honestly feel at this point, like, Tom kind of pushed me into Roger's arms.
Like, he just pushed me away to the point where I want to see where it goes with Roger.
And I'm fed up with Tom not caring anymore but expects me to stick around.
Where's Nicole? I bought her a prize.
You okay? It's 5:30.
I know that she's hurting really, really bad right now, so I'm gonna give her girl time.
Whatever I can do to help you get through this, I'm down.
I don't want to drink anymore.
You did last night, though.
I know, 'cause Felt like if I was sober I'd be bored.
That's a problem.
Are you really not gonna drink, though? I mean, I've heard you say this before.
I know, but, like, everything that just happened, that's, like, a wake-up call.
To drink or not to drink.
Take it one day at a time.
On Thursday night, want a glass of Pinot, there's nothing wrong with that.
Oh, yeah, I think Pinot's okay.
- Exactly.
- Pregnant people do it.
Exactly.
Hi, snooki.
Hi.
What happened? Go to bed.
What? Who's going to bed? You can't talk.
Use sign language.
We need to cheer up snooki, so it's a perfect time to whip out the flip cams and start videotaping each other.
Snooki poof? What happened? Like, I saw you all the time last summer.
What it is is I feel neglected.
Oh, okay.
This [Bleep]Damn bitch will not rock me, but I'm still here.
All right, so now we're here with the famous, famous jwoww boobs.
Well, um, I just want to first point out that, um, I never really was small? - Okay.
- I'm just now huge.
Oh, okay.
And I just stick out there.
Like, I'm like, "jwoww.
" It's, like, wow.
I know jenni has been with a lot of gorillas.
Who works you better, the gorillas or Tom? [Laughter] He's gonna suffocate.
I can't breathe! The boobs are suffocating.
'Cause I did nothing [Bleep] Wrong up until the day I went for Jersey, and you still treated me like [Bleep].
No, you treat me like [Bleep].
[Phone dialing] - I got a date with a with a t-shirt press.
What about you? Who, me? - You coming? - Yeah.
Hey.
Would I be able to come see you Saturday, or are you not gonna be there? Yeah! Ryder's just She's my best friend in the whole wide world, and she's coming to visit, so I'm very excited to see her.
- All right, love you.
- Love you.
Bye.
Wah.
[Solemn pop music] don't want to be here.
Why? You were so good yesterday.
I know.
I let you have your hotdog break.
I let you just have a break.
I let you make a hoodie for yourself that you aren't even wearing.
'Cause I'm not done yet.
You're not gonna be done.
Come on.
Let's go, please.
Come on.
Come on.
[Bleep] Move.
Another day in the office? Yeah.
Men's opinion.
Should I You looked pretty happy with that dude.
Should I attempt to just try and stay with Tom? You need to go with what makes you happy.
Really? I haven't done anything.
I haven't I won't even kiss him.
No, I know, you know.
Just friends.
But you seem happy.
I know.
I think Jenny and Roger as a couple would be amazing.
That's, like, your typical, gorilla, guidette couple, and they would have the most amazingly cute babies ever.
Can't snap out of it? Huh? Well, Danny's horrible.
What? Danny's annoying me.
Oh.
Nicole really just can't catch a break.
I can tell in her face she's becoming depressed, and I decide to call Roger, and I'm like, "I need your help.
" Oh, my God.
This is Nick.
Thank you so much.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
You too.
How you been? Good.
Thank you.
What's going on? I appreciate that.
Can we go? I don't want to get fired.
- I have to ask.
- Oh, my God.
This is, like, what I've been waiting for my entire life.
He's gorgeous, but he's Irish.
I kind of like all Italian, but, you know, we'll mix it up.
You work with each other, or different? - Nah.
- You do your thing? So you wear a hard hat? Wear a hard hat With your shirt off, and, like, blue jeans? There's our boss.
Great.
He's probably gonna come over and yell.
Just stand up and stare at him.
He'll back down.
- Stare him down? - Yeah.
Love you.
- Come on, girls.
- All right.
You said you were gonna be in front of the store.
I didn't know we were gonna sneak off to Bubba's.
Your shift ends soon.
Thank you, Danny, for not yelling.
Holy, [Bleep].
Nick is [Bleep] Perfect.
Like, perfect.
I've been nothing but fair to you today.
He was yum.
I was yelling? No, I said "he was yum.
" Okay, he was yum.
Okay.
- T-shirt sales.
Yay.
Good stuff, jwoww.
Can we help anyone? - Do you love me? - Ugh.
Or do you love me? I'm gonna [Bleep] My pants right now.
[Laughter] Girl I wanna do it don't you wanna do it we gonna do it I prayed to the gods to have a nice, juice-head gorilla, and I finally got one.
Thank you.
I have to go home and break into my house and get my dogs.
Right now I want to kill Tom.
He just left the dogs there to pretty much die.
[Crying] I do not deserve this.
- Get dressed.
- How was work? It was fine.
It sucked until we saw boys.
You guys saw boys? Roger brought a boy for me.
Roger brought the perfect man for her.
- Yeah? Cute? - Bangin'.
So we're gonna do the boardwalk tonight, and I'm really excited, because I feel like Nicole's gonna be happy all over again, and I miss that about her.
Might have to double panty it.
Because it's gonna be bad.
Feel like I have to poop.
I'm getting nervous.
Because you're excited? Yeah, and every time I get excited, I have to poop.
Every time I get really excited, like, if we go to a club, I have to [Bleep] My pants.
If we go to a party, I [Bleep] My pants.
If I go on a date like this with a hot guy, I have to [Bleep] My pants.
Like, I get really excited.
I just had a baby in the toilet.
[Toilet flushes] Ooh, it's so juicy.
That's what she said.
[Knock at door] Aah! Oh, hello.
You can come in.
Nick walks in, and the first thing I thought to myself was, "ugh, I'm jealous.
He's gorgeous.
You go, Nicole.
" Like, you know, and he is perfect for her.
And I get stuck with Alex.
Is that enough tickets for everybody? It's gonna fall out! Don't worry about it.
I'll catch you.
[Screaming] I'm just having a great time.
I think this date is solidifying that I just shouldn't be with Tom, and the grass is greener on the other side.
Stop! It's not on that tight.
Stop.
I like to joke around a lot, and he jokes around.
That's what I need, and I was worried that he wasn't going to be like that, because then it's, like, awkward, and you're like, "okay, you're boring me," but he's definitely an awesome guy.
[Screaming] Oh, God, I'm gonna vomit.
Even though I just met him, Nick feels like the perfect juice-head gorilla for me, and I also kind of want to have sex with him already.
Girl, I wanna do it don't you wanna do it we gonna do it can we do it you know you wanna do it quit playing, girlie, do it - I prayed to the gods to have a nice juice-head gorilla, and I finally got one.
Thank you.
Me and Roger did not have sex.
Yet I'm absolutely, like, infatuated with this kid, and I adore him even more.
I really don't miss Tom, and that's kind of, like, a red flag for me that I shouldn't be with him, and I'm kind of shutting Tom out as of right now.
[Phone quacking] - Hello.
- Hey, is jenni there? Uh, yeah.
Hold on one second.
- Who's it for? - Jenni.
I want to see her say it.
Jenni, telephone.
Tom.

She's like, "we got a coffee, "went to the t-shirt shop, I [Bleep]Ed Roger, then we went to" Hello? Hey, what's going on with you? You never called me.
I got [lndistinct].
I went out with Nicole.
Oh, yeah? Doing what? Boardwalk.

What do you mean you don't know? I don't know.
Is there something wrong with you? No.
Just Taking a breather.

[Laughter] - Taking a breather? - Yeah.
Just getting my independence back.
Yo, Roger that.
R r Roger that.
See anybody you know down there? - Yeah.
- Who? My friend Roger and then His friend Nick.
Oh, you been hanging out with them a lot? Yeah.
This'll be the last conversation I have with you, just let me know.
There's nothing to let you know, but if that's how you feel Is that what you want? That's bull[Bleep].
And, like, honestly, the fact that you even did this was is is I didn't do anything.
That's the problem.
No, you really did, though.
I was just having a good time and enjoying myself, unlike what I was able to do with you.
Wow.
Did you really just say that to me? What? You really just said that to me? You don't have a good time with me? I do, but not lately.
It's been hard, so I'm just trying to, like, breathe, and hang out with friends and people that I know.
Even the day that I was leaving wasn't even good.
Yeah, but, you know what? Yeah, but nothing.
So do I take that [Bleep] To heart? Yeah, because I did nothing [Bleep] Wrong up until the day I went for Jersey, and you still treated me like [Bleep].
No, you treat me like [Bleep].
Done.
With a heart attack on your plate you were looking back on your days [phone dialing] Because of the fact that I just broke up with Tom, my anxiety is so high I can't even think.
He said that he's upset, and he's starting to move out now, but Who's watching my dogs? Well, I don't know.
I'm just saying you have to do something if that bothers you that much where you think something's gonna happen.
Just please call him for me.
And say what? "Don't touch any of my [Bleep].
" - All right.
- All right.
Love you.
All right, I love you too.
- I'll talk to him again.
- All right.
- All right? - Bye.
Ugh.
The only thing that I'm concerned about with Tom is the safety of my dogs and my personal belongings.
Boo, it's, like, an emergency.
I have to go home and break into my house and get my dogs.
Will you take the drive with me? Of course.
Right now I want to kill Tom.
Like, you don't leave animals like that alone.
'Cause they can't fend for themselves.
And now he just left the dogs there to pretty much die.
What a [Bleep] Fun day this is.
I'm literally preparing for the worst.
I'm preparing for my [Bleep] To be smashed, my dogs to be, like, hiding in a corner, traumatized.
And I'm home.
Like, really? My damn keys.
Tom locked me out, and, um, he's being very malicious.
And it's one thing to draw hate towards me, but it's another to take it out on my animals.
That means the absolute world to me.
I don't know what to do right now.
Do we have to break in? [Distant barking] Oh, doggies.
Hi! Yay! Let's go.
Hi! - Whoo-hoo.
Hi! You're coming to the Jersey shore.
I have my dogs.
They're safe, they're cute, they're happy, and that's all I need.
Do you got to go pee? It's upstairs.
Yeah, I need to piss.
Hi.
What happened? Bed's gone.
What? Your bed is gone.
Really? My [Bleep] Bed.
What else did he take? That's it? It was in there? It was on the dresser in the Tom took the best personal item I could have.
My favorite piece of jewelry that I got as a present for graduation.
Had nothing to do with Tom.
If Tom's gonna be this spiteful to steal my watch, I have to make sure that he didn't steal anything else.
Yeah, that's not okay.
Are you [Bleep] Kidding me, man? Is that to him? Yeah.
I don't even want to look.
Anymore.
[Crying] I do not deserve this.
I didn't do anything to him.
He kept doing it to me.
Sorry.
And you'll be right there with me as well we'll be on the brighter side of hell my home is [Bleep] Jersey.
My little bed.
We are on the brighter side of hell we are on the brighter side we are on the brighter side of hell - who are you? - I come here to get my niece.
- What, dude? - That's my niece right there.
What the hell? What is this? Romeo and Juliet? The capulets and [Bleep] Whatever? What have I done, bro? Dude, you haven't done anything.
I haven't done [Bleep].
Ron, what are you doing? Are you friends with her? Let me know now.
Are you friends with her? [Bell tolls] You need to pick me up right now.
I need to go home.
- I'm sorry.
I'll be all right.
- Jenni's a very strong person and when I see jenni crying and breaking down, it breaks my heart and it makes me want to find tom and chop his nuts off.
- I don't know how you can top that one.
I think this is legit the worst breakup ever.
- Mm-hmm.
- Who does that? Like, I'm not even that spiteful.
I don't care about this house.
I can't wait to get rid of it.
My home's [Bleep] In Jersey in my little bed.
- Your little nook.
- Yeah, next to the bathroom.
- Mm-hmm.
- Who the [Bleep] Is that? - Who's knocking at the door? - Hello.
- Hey, ryder.
- Hi.
- What's up? - How are you? - Good.
Nicole's somewhere with jenni.
I don't know when she's gonna be back.
- Really? - Did she know you were coming? - Mm-hmm.
- Ryder's here and it's a little weird, because, you know, I do have a little bit of a past with ryder.
- You had sex with my best friend.
- Who? - Ryder.
- What do you mean? - I saw your [Bleep] Ass, ! - And Nicole's not around.
- Did you meet the new girl? - Hi, I'm deena.
- Hi, how are you? - I've heard everything about you.
- Nicole gave me strict instructions.
"Do not have sex with my best friend.
" So I really don't know what to do at this point.
So what's new, ryder? - Just turned 22.
- Really? When? - On Thursday.
- Happy Birthday.
- Thank you.
- Bet you and Nicole will be celebrating.
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, you can hang out with me.
- She's a blast in a glass.
- Yeah.
- I've been, like, changing my locks on a beautiful day.
- Tom has keys to the house - Thank you.
- So me and jenni decide to get her a newKnob.
- Pretty sure we're gonna need instructions on this.
Me and Nicole are trying to put on these locks.
"For top latch, rotate front of latch "180 degrees.
For bottom latch, grasp spring-" what does that mean? - I don't know.
- And it's just not working.
Do we have to shave down the door? - What do you mean? - Then I notice that they're not fitting in the door.
- No, this is supposed to be there.
- No.
You sure? - Yeah, look.
They match.
- We're mixing up the old locks with the new locks.
- Know any juiceheads around here that can help us? - You want to call someone? We're, like, doing things backwards.
- That's it? - We was supposed to open it first.
- Are we stuck? - We just don't know what the hell we're doing with these locks.
We're locked in the house.
- It's so annoying that they're not here.
- But I'm glad I have you here, because I would have been going to the gym.
We're waiting for Nicole to get here so we can play.
Ryder, are you ready to play? - Yeah.
- Yes.
- Fitted.
- Let's do happy hour.
We'll do a bar crawl and it'll be a good time.
- Margaritas! - ? margaritas ? margaritas.
- Rar! - What do you want to take a shot of? - We're gonna do a shot and this? - For your birthday.
- Happy Birthday.
- It's her birthday.
- Thank you.
- Happy Birthday! - Oh, dear.
- Oh, man.
- Am I gonna puke? - No.
- I'm gonna puke, I bet.
Oh, my God.
Am I gonna puke? - Such a good time.
- Oh, my God.
I'm gonna throw up on everyone.
- Why? You don't like spinning? - No.
- ? to drink a little more than I should ? - don't peer pressure her.
- Yay! - ? I tell myself I'm staying in ? but then I hear something good - cheers to happy hour.
- Whoo! - I love happy hour.
- The happiest hour ever.
- ? I hear the melody ? I feel the beat and the bass line yeah - I'm like the substitute Nicole right now.
Am I doing good at least? - Mm-hmm.
- I love that sound.
- ? oh oh oh oh oh oh ? - okay.
- Got that out of the way.
Me and jenni finally figure out how to put a new knob on the door and it's really good, because ryder's probably flipping out that I'm not home.
It's her birthday and she's probably like, "what the?" - Want to get collars on? - ? she's packing everything she owns ? into a suitcase she spent her whole damn life - bye! - This house that I've lived in and worked hard for is just a piece of property to me at this point.
My home right now is seaside, um, where my family and friends are.
Ahh! We're going home.
- Do you and ryder want to sleep in my bed? - What have I done, man? - Dude, you haven't done anything.
- I haven't done- - I love you, babe.
- Are you friends with her? - I tried to talk before.
I'm talking to you now!Â¨ are you friends with her or no?! Happy belated always golden still the greatest - yo, look at ryder.
She looking dope tonight.
- I'm 22! - Happy Birthday.
Where's, um, snooks? Is she coming? - I don't know.
You tell me.
- If you need somewhere to sleep tonight, we have- - We have plenty of room in our room.
- We're roommates.
- Yeah, no.
There's plenty of room.
- This house itoo quiet.
- We got to put their leashes on real quick, 'cause I don't want them to, like, run.
- Which one do you want? - You want to grab Noel, since you bonded? - Let me take her.
Hello.
- Yay! Finally.
- We have fuzzy friends.
- Hello.
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
I missed you so much.
- That's a fireball.
Yo, this looks like snooki.
- Snooki and ryder.
Look at snooki and ryder.
- Hey! - That's what I'ma call 'em from now on, snooki and ryder.
- What happened? - Go get ready.
We're gonna leave at 11:00.
- Do you feel better now? - Yeah.
- Good.
- Come on.
Sorry.
Just temporarily.
- Oh, yeah.
Can't wait to sleep with that.
You see me putting a shirt on.
You know it's t-shirt time.
- All right, let's go.
- ? and I can feel a fa-fascination ? it sits above your fa-fascination yeah I can see your fa-fascination - I hate you.
I haven't seen Roger in three or four days and he just looks so good right now.
I just can't get over it.
- ? fa-fascination ? you're such a ball, go fa-fascination let it be your fa-fascination - we're at the club.
I'm enjoying myself.
And I see Ron talking to a girl at the bar.
- Sam thought I was, like, hitting on the girl.
And I was like, "what the?" You know, like, stop drinking.
Damn.
- There are a lot of cute girls at karma tonight and, you know, one girl named Gina kind of stands out to me.
Beautiful Italian girl.
So I decided to talk to her.
- What's up, man? Vinny.
- How are you? - I love cuddling.
That's my favorite.
Oh, is it? How you doing? Vinny.
Nice to meet you.
Good.
It's kind of frustrating when a girl has, like, a protective Uncle or a protective older brother or a father.
In a way, you got to respect the protection, but at the same time, it is a [Bleep] Block.
I think we're getting out of here soon.
You want to come? - Where? To the house? Yeah.
- Really? - ? I want to see some action ? q7 I need satisfaction meet me by the light - ? so tonight's a full house.
We got Roger.
- Why is the fridge open? - We got ryder.
Mike and pauly are bringing home some random girls and I got my girl Gina coming home.
Bro, I haven't had pizza since I've been here.
I haven't had pizza in three weeks.
- It's not my problem.
- You ready to go do it? - I didn't touch anybody like that.
- I [Bleep] Saw it, you idiot.
- What? Who? On who? - You.

You know what? That's your own imagination.
You're gonna realize someday sadly.
You know what you just did? The last person you had in this house - Are you gone? 'Cause I'm gonna go home.

I'm not getting into that one.

- Don't.
Don't [] Bring me anything.
I don't get an apology.
"I'm sorry.
" Not a hug or nothing.
I get a piece of pizza.
Not a [] Protein shake.
You bring me pizza of all things.
Really? No.
It's on a different level right now.
Don't bring me [] Anything.
- What does that mean? - What I'm saying is I took your [], put it over there.
Pack it and - oh, my God.
- Yep.
Think it's funny.
I'm on a different level.
- That's not funny.
- I'm on a different level as you right now.
- What did you say? - I've done nothing but take care of you.
- What did I do? - What did I do for you to throw my [] Around? - He's upstairs giggling, throwing [] Everywhere.
Giggling.
- And he's giggling? - As he's throwing.
- Aww.
If he's giggling, game over.
- Yep.
You ow, come on, man.
This is just a little ridiculous right now.
If you're in a relationship and fighting that much, is it that fun? - I hope you have a [] Book for the apology you have to Write me in the morning.
Cry all you [] Want.
Your tears don't mean [] To me.
- You all right? - Just so you know.
- To put on? All right.
Come on.
- What about me? - Your name's skip.
- Excuse me? - Your name is skip tonight.
- My name is not skip.
- Yo, Mike, I got to sound the horn, bro.
- Yo, hurry that chick out of here.
- Can I sound it? - Only if you get her out.
- Hold on.
I'll be right back.
- Can someone explain what the horn is? - You'll see.
- Tonight, there's a grenade running around the house - I just want something that's not what I have on.
- So I got the grenade horn Where is it? In the house that lets seaside know when grenades are present at the Jersey shore house.
When there's some grenades or some beasts present at the house, we got the grenade whistle.
- Wait, excuse me, mister.
- I'll give you pants.
Hold on one second.
- I'm right here.
- What's up? - I need something to do.
- Well, go-what do you- what do you mean you need something to do? - Pauly d.

I got to pee.

Good thing I'm trained in the art of dodging a grenade, so that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
I'ma dodge this grenade.
- Come on, pauly.
- Where we going? - Come on, this way.
This way.
Long way.
Who are you? - Who am I? Who are you? - Roger! - What the hell? - Hi.
- That's my niece right there.
- I heard a story about you today.
- You know what Mike said they said at the barbershop? - What? That I like to.
- Are you kidding? - Are you friends with her or not? - Stop.
- Look at me.
Stop! Talk to me! - Hello? - You need to pick me up right now.
I need to go home.

This is my sister's beautiful daughter and I need to pick her up.

- She coming out or what? - All right.
- J? - I won't do that over there.
As beautiful as I think she is, knowing that she has a swarm of guys surrounding her doesn't make me want to call her again.
- Okay.
You out? - Mm-hmm.
- Okay, bye, sweetie.
- Bye.
- You sure you want to leave? - I just want to know why he left.
- That's what I'm saying.
You need to salvage that.

Sayonara.
She was a hating friend, yo.
- Yeah.
He was right.
- Look at me.
You don't deserve to be punished.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Ron, I understand.
Listen.
We all understand.
Though the other day, you put me in the corner Position and she begged and begged and begged and begged for us to tell her the truth, so we told her the truth.
But we told her the truth for her to leave.
I never knew in a million years I'd ever get in a fight with her.
'Cause the moment you walked in that door last year and you'll take that.
You don't deserve this anymore.
- I learned my lesson.
If you love someone, care about someone - ? if there were a way ? I would even the score - oh, God.
- Boy, I've been through that mind game.
- Seriously, bro, like, I have I done anything? - Dude, you haven't done anything.

- Are you friends with her or no? - You? - Whatever you want.
- If he's friends with her, I'm out.
I'm t of here.
Out of here.
Playing me like that.
- The lights went out.
With this Jersey shore breeze.
- Look at me.
This is it.
Lowk at me.
Are you friends with her or not? - Don't touch me.
- Then talk to me.
'Cause I'm done with this.
- I don't want to talk to you.
I don't want to talk to you.

Blow 'em out.
- Ahh! - You're all right, kid.
Chill.

What happened? - Okay, come right now, okay? - Yo, we're gonna have to have a family meeting.
Sam just hit- Sam just hit him.
- She literally just snuffed me in my face.
Like, just cracked me in my jaw.
- And she's upstairs.
Like, the chick's upstairs.
- The last person she had in this house, she just pushed away.
- All right.
All right.
Give me a hug.
I got your back.
You know I do, all right? - Sam, seriously, dude.
Look at you.
- This is- this is God telling me to go.
- No.
This is not God.
God isn't your ego.
- He's friends with jenni.
- Who cares? - I do, vin! - Sammi's ego is like a brick wall.
There's no getting through to Sammi when she's being stubborn.
You're acting like Angelina.
- Look at me.
I punched a kid in the [] Face.
- You're like Angelina right now.
- Because he's a.
I can't live here anymore.
I can't do it.
I'm leaving.
My mom's on her way and that's it.
I'm out.
- Don't-you can't you can't leave, Sam.
You still have friends in this house.
- I can't stay here.
- You still have friends in this house.
- After everything I've been through, I personally can't be friends with that girl jenni.
He talked so much And everything - don't be friends.
- Sam, I love you! - And he goes and be friends with her? Get the [] Out of here! That's the fakest That I've ever met in my entire life that's fake.
- I don't know why they're gonna make her stay, because you know what? If she stays, I'm just gonna make her life miserable.
She got no [] Idea.
I had sympathy for her in Miami.
- I want to go.
- I know you want to go.
- I don't want to be here.
- I know you want to go.
- How can I enjoy my life living with an ex-boyfriend who you still care about? Tell me.
- Okay.
'Cause you need sucky things in life to make you stronger.
And you need us.
We're gonna tie you down to the bed.
I'm sorry.
- It's ruined.
I'm miserable here.
- Sam, good.
Be miserable, but you're gonna do it.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
- You know what, Sam? I think you're making a big mistake and - she's not making a mistake.
She's not doing it.
- I need to go.
This isn't for me anymore.
I didn't want to hear what anybody had to say.
Like, I want to go.
And all those people over there were, like, saying some nice, consoling things.
Even though I just punched one of their roommates in the face, they were up there trying to help me out and I didn't want to hear it.
I get it, but, like, at this point, it's not worth it.
- You're really gonna leave? You're really gonna leave, Sam? - ? she thinks ? she knows everything all about love - Shh.
- I want to play with the dog.
- She hates you.
- I'll teach him how to pimp.
- It's a girl.
- It's a girl.
- My bad.
Want a meatball? - God, Bella, shut up.
I need her to shut the other one up, so I can get it in.
I know she does, but I need - wait.
You're trying to do sex? - Shh! - Can I have the dog in my bed? - No, 'cause then the other one barks.
Originally, I thought Roger could maybe be, like, a rebound for tom and I never thought in a million years that I'd actually sleep with him this quick.
But I'm really developing feelings for the kid.
Like, he's everything I want in a guy.
So why not? - ? what goes on in the Jersey shore house ? what goes on It's 7:00.
I'm going home.
- Where's your mom at? - She'll be on her way.
- This is definitely the longest night here at the Jersey shore house in a very long time.
- How am I gonna spoon my best friend? - Do you and ryder want to sleep in my bed? - Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
- She wants to leave.
You know that, right? - Yeah.
- 'Cause without you, she has nobody.
- Shh.
Here she comes.
- I'm sorry I punched you in the face.
Truly sorry.
Um, I feel extremely hurt That you're friends with jenni after everything.
And I punched you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I don't like jenni, and I'm hurt that you would befriend her.
No? You don't have to accept my apology this time.
But before I leave here, you need to know how I feel.
This is my final good-bye to you, so, um You can say whatever you want.
Really? Okay.
- What do I do, bro? - Let her go, bro.
Right now, you need to do what's best for Ronnie.
Everything else will fall in place, dawg.
You know what I mean? You're a big man.
You'll be all right.
- It's hard though, bro.
- I'm sorry.
Will you go inside with me, please? For the last time? Can I hug you good-bye? No? Can I? - I feel like I owe Ron an extreme apology.
Punching Ron in the face, getting upset that he was talking to jenni that was a bad thing.
What am I doing? I'm wasting time hating somebody when it's not worth it.
It's not worth-like, look what I'm doing to myself.
It's not about the relationship.
It's about jenni that made me punch Ron in the face.
Nothing to do with me and Ron or the fight.
It was the whole jenni thing.
And it's disgusting that I took it to that level.
I'm gonna take it day by day and work on the relationship with Ron, my boyfriend.
But also with everybody in this house, including jenni.
- Hello? - Hello.
I call my mom.
I tell her that everything's fine, and I'm staying in seaside.
- It was a bad day, huh? - Yeah.
I punched him in the face.
Mom, I punched him in the face.
- Ron? - Yep.
- Are you broken up with him? - Well, I punched him in the face, so that's kinda like not okay.
- Well, you can't go any lower-that's it.
Time to pick your- - Pick up your life, huh? - That's it, pick it up and move up now, and get yourself happy.
You've gotta start doing fun things and being happy.
- I know.
You're right.
- I love you.
- Love you too.
- Bye.
- Oh, bye.
Love you.
- Unh! - Thanks for coming.
- Here, sweetie.
- Look at that spread right there! - All right, uh Thankful for everybody sitting down today.
And thanks that Sam decided to stay.
- Thank you.
Thank you guys for being there.
It turns out you guys are really cool, and good people.
And I'm happy I'm here.
- Salud! - I think Sammi's maturing, and she's realizing that she's been wrong.
And she's finally looking outside the box, instead of being stubborn and hardheaded.
- It's date night, right? So it's, like, this date night, and jenni's going out with her boy Roger.
And deena's going out with the Ronnie look-alike, Dean.
- I don't even think it looks like Ronnie.
- No, when he was dancing, he was, like - Eww! - Like Ronnie does.
- He probably studies Ronnie's every move.
And then he's, like, "I want to be Ron.
" - Ooh, stop it.
- This is great.
- I'd like to say here's to you two bailing me and Dean out of jail tonight.
- To doing something dumb.
- Why? What do you mean? - We'll figure it out what it happens.
- That wasn't a good "cheers.
" - It's only our second date.
I think tonight we should just keep it classy.
We'll go on rides, everything.
- Listen, just throw that first line out the window right now.
Keep it classy? You serious? - Vinny! - What do you want to do? - I'll do whatever.
I just don't want to stay here.
- I want to hang out with Nicole so she's not left out.
And instead of going to dinner, we decided to do something a little more exciting.
Oh, these are dope! - How much is the stripper pole? - $230.
- I'll get it.
- Nicole has this idea to buy a stripper pole for the house, and I want the Stripper pole.
- It doesn't come up "stripper pole" on my credit card, right? My dad will be, like, what the? - This house needs a stripper pole.
- Cool.
It's like Christmas.
- It is like Christmas.
- Is it tall enough? - OhNow what? What about right there in that doorway? - Oh- - Oh, this might work.
- Putting it in the middle of the kitchen? Try and swing on it.
- It works.
- You gotta screw it into the ground though.
- Oh, yeah, this is gonna- yeah.
- We gotta screw it to the ground.
Yeah, buddy.
That's the first thing I said when I walked through the door in this house I was, like, "all I need is a stripper pole.
" Honestly, bro, it doesn't get any better than this.
Unless we had a stripper pole, like, right in the middle of the room.
And now I have it.
So we're good.
- Yo, that's the same one I got in my room.
- Yeah! - Oh, pauly - It's not that sturdy.
Like, no fat girls can go on it.
But it would be pretty funny.
- I'm going to get a haircut.
- Barber shop.
Barber shop.
- You ready for your haircut, little man? - Yeah, buddy it's too quiet in here.
- We're cutting the top, right? - Yeah, a little trim.
- Yo, p, when Ronnie's stunt double comes in, does he ask for the same cut as my dude? - Yeah.
- You know what's funny? He said she wanted to [Bleep] His ass, and he wasn't about it.
You didn't hear that? - One of the barbers says that Dean, deena's man, announced that deena likes to You know - So she wanted to, or he wanted her? - No, she wanted to.
- Oh, she wanted to.
- Deena I can't even say it.
- Yo, did he ask her why she did that? - 'Cause he said it was cleaned out in the jacuzzi.
- Okay.
- If anything, it makes it worse.
- I don't think I'd share a drink with deena, or a cigarette with deena, or qnything that has to do with touching deena's lips in the near future.
- Damn, that's a good story right there.
I heard a story about you today.
- Was it good or bad? - It's in the middle.
It was, like, a barber shop dude story.
- Something about, like, sex or something? - Something around those lines.
- I heard a story about you today.
You want to walk on the treadmill with me? - And you'll tell me? - I'll tell you.
I really couldn't control myself.
This type of juicy information needs to be, you know, brought out immediately.
- I have not hooked up with anyone around here.
- Well, who did you hook up with? - That kid Dean.
- Okay, so I guess it has maybe it's something about that.
It's just something that you like.
- That I like? - Yeah.
Everybody has preferences.
You happen to like this particular preference.
- I know-I think I know what you're talking about because it's coming back to me.
- Yes, it definitely is coming back to you.
When you were drunk, you- - And if that's the case, then I think I do like to do that.
- Oh, so that's real good.
Well, listen, if you like to do that, good for you.
- Wait.
I don't know what we're talking about.
- Um, let's just say you like to, um You don't like to, you know, [Bleep], but you like to.
- Well, that's not true 'cause it's not true.
I would never in my life.
Let's be real.
Was I being talked about at the barber shop? - Mm-hmm.
Yeah, and they said that He wanted you to [Bleep] His thing, but you said no, you will.
- No, that never happened.
I would never, ever.
I want to go home and call that kid.
My teeth and my mouth is too precious to me to go down that way.
You know what Mike said they said at the barber shop? - What? - That I like to - What? - That's not funny, 'cause that's not true.
I never would do that in my life.
- Are you kidding? - Honestly, I'm gonna frikkin' rip him a new.
I hope I see that Guy tonight.
- Yeah, down here! - So at karma, I see Dean, and I basically tell him to go [] Himself.
Like, get away from me I don't want to talk to you, it's done.
It makes me feel fantastic to make him look like a douche bag at the club.
You make me look like a douche bag at that barber shop? Here you go, baby.
This is on you.
Karma's a bitch, literally.
You're an amazing piece of.
- so we're at karma, and we're just having a good time.
So basically I'm, like, I'm gonna go over to Ron and Sam and, you know, see where it goes.
Never in a million years would I ever think I'd be the one to make the first move to talk to Sammi, but my mood has changed lately, and I'm just happy.
So I could care less about small.
- I just feel a lot better that I'm here talking to jenni and kind of just, like kind of being mature about everything, and putting it behind us.
- The drama between me, Sam, and Ron has gone on way too long, and now I feel like the house, as a whole, will have a better vibe.
- I was mad at jenni for a lot of wrong reasons.
And being able to move forward makes me feel happy.
But when it comes to Ron, let's take this day by day, see what happens.
Adriano_csi 
What have I done, bro? Dude, you haven't done anything.
I haven't done [bleep].
I love you, bro.
- I'm sorry, like, for everything.
- And I'm sorry.
Ron, are you friends with her? Let me know now.
Are you friends with her? [bell tolls] I want to go.
How can I enjoy my life living with an ex-boyfriend? Tell me.
Okay.
'Cause you need sucky things in life to make you stronger.
I'm truly blessed.
It turns out you guys are really good people, and it took me a lot to realize that.
I'm gonna take it day by day and work on the relationship with Ron, my boyfriend, but also with everybody in this house, including Jen.
I unfortunately punched Ron in the face, and in some way it kind of brought the house a lot closer.
[Get Crazy by LMFAO] I'm going to the Jersey shore, bitch! All right, we got a situation.
I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
[laughing] After I have sex with a guy, I will rip their heads off.
Go Vinny! Go Vinny! The drama between me, Sam, and Ron has gone on way too long, and now I'm glad that the drama's over, and hopefully we can move on from this.
That was mine.
My shot! Everyone's having a good time.
Everyone's getting along in the house.
But, once again, one step forward, two step backs.
Yes.
Yes.
In Miami, Ron got [bleep] faced to a point where he was incoherent, so I'm scared, a little bit nervous that the same thing's gonna happen.
Everybody bounce.
Let's go.
Take take 'em if you want.
Let's go.
We're walking home.
Let's go.
Vinny's good.
Vinny's good.
I got to make sure Vinny's okay.
Where's our [bleep] cab? Come on, girl.
Um, I'll take you up here.
Come on.
I'm with Ronnie.
Don't worry about a thing.
[dogs barking] Doggies! Here's a t-shirt.
- It's purple.
- I know.
It says - It's all right it's purple.
- Says "situation" on it.
- Does it? - Yeah.
Look.
You want this or no? - Please heat it up.
- Yeah.
Where's Nicole? [Bleep] this.
[Bleep].
- [bleep].
- Ron, I'm making you food.
Whatever.
Ron, here.
Look what I got you, baby.
Here.
I got you something.
[spits] The room at this point is doing [bleep] somersaults, Spinning.
It's flipping.
Doing 360s.
I'm likeUgh! [belches] You gonna throw up Yeah? You gonna throw up, Ron? - You all right, baby? - [retching] Oh, my God.
I hate throw-up.
I don't do throw-up.
I get really sick.
I start throwing up.
If I smell throw-up, that's the end of it.
I can't stay there.
Ew, poop! I just stuck my hand in your throw-up.
Aah! [Laughs] [dogs bark] That's where you are? Oh, my God.
Gotta get her out of here.
Baby? I got, like, 20 feet.
I don't know how I'm gonna do this.
Ow.
Ow, ow.
Ow, stop.
I got you.
Just go right there.
I don't know what happened.
I don't care.
- Guess where I found her? - Where? In my dog thing.
- Sleeping? - Sleeping.
[laughter] Get the [bleep] out of here.
Oh, I feel like [bleep].
Uh, I wake up this morning, and my stomach's not agreeing with me.
And it's just all messed up.
- What? - What? I need to go to the bathroom.
Ron, talk to me.
- I'll be all right.
- No, what? The look on his face, you could just tell something's not right.
Really? I don't know if it's from the alcohol, or - Do you want me to go with you? - Yeah.
Why is Ronnie bleeding out of his ass? I have no idea.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- How's it going? - Uh, not so good.
Yeah.
I hear.
Has that area ever been checked before? - Um, no.
- No.
- I mean, I get checkups, but - Never there.
Um, what were gonna do is, we're gonna check out the area.
We're not gonna do anything crazy, so you don't have to worry.
We're not gonna, um, you know, do any scopes, or anything crazy like that.
[laughs] You know [elevator music playing] Nobody likes the snap of the rubber gloves, Ron.
- So don't worry about it.
- Yeah.
You're just gonna feel a little bit of lubricating jelly, okay? All right, again, I promise I won't do anything graphic.
I'm just gonna take a look.
Ron, I'm just gonna touch a couple of areas.
Tell me if you feel pain, okay? - How about here? - No.
Good.
- Here.
- No.
How about deeper in through here? yah-ee Almost through here.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Is there any pain around the rim at all? - No.
- No, good.
We're done.
I'm like, "doc, come on, you can at least buy me dinner.
" [bleep].
I don't move that fast on the first date.
Um, and the bleeding should stop.
- Okay.
- Okay? I would probably stay away from alcohol.
The doctor said that I messed up my [bleep] Because I pretty much need to control my drinking, and that's what I'm gonna do.
- Did you have clamps or anything? - No.
He just went No, he didn't stick his hand up there.
He didn't [bleep] my crack.
It's not a [bleep] hardcore porno.
It was wrong of me to laugh.
Who wants to bleed out of their butt? I wouldn't.
It's not hemorrhoids, or anything like that.
He's gonna give me cream.
- Cream? - Yeah.
It was uncomfortable with his finger in my butt.
I am so excited to bring home your typical, seaside guido.
You were engaged? She's a good girl.
You could get hurt, dog.
U better send roses to the house.
You feel me? Roses, dog.
With pickles in 'em.
Fried pickles! We're actually not gonna go get our nails done today, Nick.
We're not? You want to go tomorrow between shifts? Okay.
Me and you will go run errands at the pharmacy.
- Yeah, I'll go with you.
- All right.
I hate when girls say they never masturbated.
They're tying.
- I'm like, "come on, really?" - They're lying.
"Really? You never ever masturbate?" "you never tried it and it was a phenomenal?" I remember when you asked Sam.
She said she never.
- Really? It's a lie.
- Well, I did.
I think masturbating is healthy.
- It is healthy.
- It Is.
What's wrong with that? Me, Deena, and Jenni, every time we have a conversation, it's a [bleep]ed up conversation.
We have no shame when it comes to discussing what goes on in our sex life.
You work your muscles.
Remember I did it all day once? And the next day, I couldn't even move.
*** I turn the corner, and there's Nicole on a little tricycle.
Okay.
Let's go down this way.
- Do you guys have eyelash glue? - In aisle three on your left side.
[rings bell] Blecch! Oh, my God.
I cut a corner to get in the other aisle, and the frickin' handlebars fall off.
I don't want to pay for it.
Ooh, put it back.
Put it back.
I never had this.
Let's go about our day.
Slip 'n slide.
The tricycle's 150 bucks.
We're not paying for this little thing, so we wedged the handlebars back on, and, like, kind of, like, shoot it away and run.
She's so needy, this one.
She reminds me of myself.
That one reminds me of me, a wild animal.
Really? You guys not getting ready? - Really? - You look mad hot.
- I want to make out with you.
- You should probably do that.
Can I make out with you as well? - That'd be a good time.
- I get it first.

Yeah, all three of us.
- Can we? - Yeah.

I mean, what don't I do for Sami besides wipe her ass for her and breathe for her? Time to eat.
Yay.
Go, Ron! - Holy [bleep].
- Whoo! That's what's up.
Ron, I'm not mad at that at all, Ron.
[bleep] tastes good.
Everything's great.
Nicely done, Ron.
- Ron, is this vodka sauce? - Yeah.
It's pretty good.
In the beginning of dinner, the vibe was pretty [bleep], because there's a lot of tension between Ron and Sam.
I mean, you wish you could press, like, the freeze button, you know what I'm saying? And fast forward it until they're done fighting, they [bleep], and then they're fine.
How was everybody's night? Jiminy cricket.
I had a dream that Vinny and Pauly made out.
You know there's a lot of truth to dreams right? [laughter] Awkward.
I mean, I have a headache from dealing with Ronnie and Sam's relationship.
I feel like I'm in the relationship, and it's not even mine.
This is such a bad time.
I just can't even talk about it right now.
Just it's actually giving me a headache right now.
Oh, my God.
Roger's a good time that I don't want to screw up, because he's not done anything yet.
I'm not gonna tolerate anything.
Ow! We were talking.
I know.
That's why I threw it at you.
I [bleep] up six months ago.
Big deal.
You're the fakest in the house, and I' make you crumble real [bleep] quick.
What's going on? Oh, they're fighting.
You know what? Break the [bleep] up.
I just want my space.
I just want to be left alone, and Sam doesn't get that.
She just wants to pick and pick, pick and pick.
Then why are you mad at me? Nothing to do with you, Sam.
- Promise? - Yeah.
Sammi, we're leaving.
I'm, like, mentally preparing myself to get yelled at by Danny right now.
Hey, bitch.
Hello, hello.
Hey.
Good afternoon, Danielson.
You're two hours late and you're not wearing a shirt? Get serious, girls.
Danny's such a buzzkill.
Like, relax, bro.
It's a t-shirt shop.
You need a Xanax.
Relax.
This is 25.
I don't think you're an extra large.
No? I'm a medium.
There's no way.
I just don't like work because I don't like working.
I have to be like, "hi, how are you doing? "how are you? Do you want a shirt? Oh, no, you don't? Okay.
Enjoy your day.
" That's not me! So why don't you sell those two ladies a tank top? I already asked.
They don't want any.
They don't want anything from you? - Mm-hmm.
- That's the wrong answer.
My favorite part of the job is hanging out with Jenny, because Jenny's my best friend, and we can just, you know, have girl time at work.
And I am single, but it's, like, I'm happy Seeing Roger.
And what is single? Like, single's, like, being alone and, like, looking and hooking up with all these people that I'm just not interested in.
- Like me.
- Not like you.
- Yeah, like me.
- You're having fun.
I'm [bleep] lonely, and I can't find anybody.
I hate being single.
I'm just saying, Jenni.
You just broke up with tom, and now you're with somebody else.
That's it.
But he's just a good time right now.
Like, Roger's a good time that I don't want to screw up, because he's not done anything yet to piss me off.
The moment he does something, I'm out.
I'm not gonna tolerate anything.
Ow! That's abuse.
- Yeah.
- We were talking.
I know.
That's why I threw it at you.
Now get on the floor.
Make some sales.
You guys ain't coming out? I think Sam might go out.
Why aren't you going out? You can go.
I know I can go out.
I'm choosing to stay home.
Want to just break up? That's your answer to every problem.
Whatever, dude.
Don't talk to me like that.
You selfish bitch.
Go the [bleep] out.
Do me a favor.
Pauly, ready? We're going.
Cab's here.
I need to be by myself.
What's going on? Oh, they're fighting.
So is she coming or what? 'cause I don't have time for the fight.
I don't know, bro.
So I'm gonna back off.
Do what you want.
I just don't want to talk about it right now, to be honest with you.
- Oh, my God.
- Just go downstairs.
Leave me alone.
Please.
Hell has to be just like this.
Yeah.
I don't even know why Ron and Sam were fighting right now.
I mean, we're waiting for Sam who's straightening her hair, whose hair is already straight.
Come on, man.
The only thing that needs to be straightened out is her brain.
Sam, are you coming? When are you leaving? Any minute.
Probably not.
- Wha? - Probably not.
Probably not.
She's not going.
That's a no.
[sighs] All right.
All right, that's enough.
You guys have managed to [bleep] up t-shirt time.
Now I'm changing my t-shirt.
Whoo! Party.
Shots! Last time I seen Danielle, she threw a drink in my face.
I got my eyes open and I got my guard up.
I don't know what she'll do.
What part of don't you understand "look me in the face and break up with me" don't you understand? Guys ready to roll out? All right, Sam.
Well, since it's only me and the boys, I guess I'm drinking tonight.

I'm just like got me blazin' body's flamin' hotter than a heater Yo, face down, ass up, that's the way I like to have a good time.
[laughs] Last time I seen Danielle, she threw a drink in my face.
So now I'm seeing Danielle, I got my eyes open, and I got my guard up.
I don't know what she'll do.
What's up? Danielle stalked my whole entire life last summer.
Well, I don't hold a grudge.
We made a truce.
Now we'll see if she changes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I had a talk with him today about everything.
Mm-hmm.
I'm like, "what's wrong with you?" Like, "what did I do now?" Like, what did I do now? - So that's what I'm thinking.
- You didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything, like always.
So then I'm like, "okay.
" Next thing you know, I come up, I'm like, "what is your problem?" or whatever.
I'm like, "do you want to just break up?" 'cause, you know, I'm not gonna deal with this.
All you do is fight.
Does he have his period? Oh, my God.
Oy.
What a good time.
Holy [bleep] it's cold in here.
- It is cold as [bleep].
- Right over here, girl.
Where? Bathroom "a.
" The second I get Danielle to the house, the first thing I do is grab the actual "I heart Jewish girls" shirt that she made me last year.
Don't say I never gave you something.
"I heart Jewish girls.
" Oh, my God.
I did the star of David by myself.
I know she thinks I threw it away or whatever.
I kept it.
And so I want to wear it And then come out with it.
And just to see that face expression would be priceless to me.
What are you eating? Italian sausage? No, it's not kosher.
I don't eat that no more.
- Shut the hell up.
- I get all my food blessed.
Know what I'm saying? Feel me knocking? [laughter] This is the shirt you revealed last year.
The look on the face of Danielle was priceless, and that's all I was looking for.
See, this shirt is dope, right? It's all good now.
- Yeah, buddy.
- Stalker.
[laughs] Danielle is at the house tonight.
Danielle, stalker, [bleep] stage-five clinger, alert, alert, is in my house tonight.
What are you doing here? I just don't get it.
You just threw a drink in his face the other night.
- We made peace, bro.
- We made peace.
You're the last person I'd ever expect to be here in this house.
Me too.
Me three.
You're a nice guy.
I feel like Danielle definitely has, like, a Pauly d, like, metal detector.
Beep, beep, beep.
Beep, beep, beep, beep.
Pauly.
And blowouts.
And hair gel.
Yo, when you give birth, right, when you're about to have a baby, what kind of bird comes and delivers the baby? - A stork.
- Stork.

Idiot.
You idiot.
- You why are you laughing? - I wasn't laughing at that.
Yo, what did Jack climb up? - The bean what? - What? Jack, what did he climb up, the bean what? - Stalk.
- Stalk.
What girl does stay in the house after giving her all this [bleep] about stalking my life? I don't know what goes on through this girl's head.
All right, it was glad we made peace.
- I'll see you.
- Bye.
Have fun this summer.
What the [bleep]? [laughter] Come back over here.
It's cold.
Want to come back here? I straight up don't want to do this with you anymore.
Stop threatening me.
Seriously.
Why do you always take it to negative? Do you want to come to bed with me? Obviously not, if I haven't gotten up over there yet.
Ron.
Look at me.
Can you tell me what the [bleep] I did? Because this isn't fair to me right now.
It's not fair to me anymore.
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
So if you want this to be over, let's break up.
Ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra.
She talks so much sometimes, I'm just like, "[bleep] it.
" Like, I can't take this [bleep].
So are we listen to me right now.
I want to be mature and talk about this.
We're done? - You're over? - Mm-hmm.
Look me in the face and break up with me, please.
What part of don't you understand "look me in the face and break up with me" - don't you understand? - Is that what you want? It's over.
We're broken up.
We're finished.
Okay? Relationship with Sam this summer, big ball of [bleep].
Seriously, can you talk to me? Ron.
Listen to me, because I'm done with this.
I know, but I need closure.
I need [bleep] closure, bro.
Just [bleep] sickening.
Go the [bleep] out.
Do me a favor.
Look me in the face and break up with me, please.
It's over.
We're broken up.
We're finished.
Okay? [bleep].
- I need closure.
- There's no closure.
- Just leave me the [bleep] alone.
- I need closure, bro.
It's kind of like a drawer.
You're gonna stuff it, you're gonna stuff it, you're gonna stuff it.
Sooner or later, you can't close it.
And, you know, I think that's why I'm finally exploding, because I can't keep any more [bleep] in.
You're a [bleep] waste of time.
I [bleep] up six months ago.
Big [bleep] deal.
I'm the reason you're still here.
I'm the reason you got through Miami.
So [bleep] remember that.
Before you ever [bleep] talk down on me.
Don't turn your back on me 'cause now you think you got some friends in the house.
You're the fakest in the house, and I'll make you crumble real [bleep] quick.
You will [bleep] crumble real quick.
You get this, and get this right, and don't roll your [bleep] eyes at me.
I have been through e- [bleep]- nough.
And you will never understand what the [bleep] you put me through.
I don't think you'll ever understand it.
Ever.
So go ahead and be mad at me.
I finally realized, like, a lot.
Been making your [bleep] my [bleep] for the last three weeks.
This is it.
Like, this is the breaking point to our relationship.
And if that's the case, then I'm fine with it.
Guess it is what it is.
Yeah.
It is what it is.
Tomorrow we'll figure out the room situation.
I'm gonna move my room and my stuff out.
I think when you're living in the same room and you're up each other's ass all the time, sometimes a break away from all the negativity and just madness is the best thing.
I'm done with it.
If Sam wants to break up, then Sam wants to break up.
Me not being with her is gonna make her time here terrible.
I can make her time around me the worst time, And I'm getting to a point where it's, like, "you know what? [bleep] you.
" And that's the point that I'm at right now.
Synch by Benfo.
I had a reason to [bleep] on you in Miami.
Realize that.
So know we're done.
Leave it at that.
Got [bleep] up six months ago, and I'm done paying for it.
Watch how [bleep] stupid I get.
I got the smush room tonight! He wants to play that dirty game with you, we can play it ten times as hard.
I'm going to get Ron back the best way I know how.
I need a [bleep] hot guy right now! She actually had the balls to dance with another guy.
I wanna [bleep] wring your neck right now.
Everything is broken and ruined.
I just needed to get out of here.
- When are you leaving? - Like now.
[Get Crazy by LMFAO] DJ Pauly Delvecchio! I'm going to the Jersey Shore, bitch! All right, we got a situation.
I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
[Laughing] After I have sex with a guy I will rip their heads off.
Go Vinny! Go Vinny! You like the boobs? Do something crazy Look what we do to each other.
I can't do this anymore.
Look, if you wanna go home, I'm gonna let you go.
As much as it [bleep] kills me I need to go home and see my family and get out of this relationship that I've been in.
I need to get out of it.
[Bleep], bro.
I'm still shocked that Sam actually is leaving.
You know what, I never thought that she'd actually leave.
I don't know how to pick myself up from the hole that I've Dug myself into.
I've [bleep] myself in so many ways.
I can't even look at myself in the mirror at this point.
Come on, big dog.
Let me chill with you.
I'm gonna chill with you, big dog.
You know what I mean? It's all good.
You know what I mean? Think about what's going on in your life.
You got a lot of good things, man.
- She was a good thing, though, bro.
- I know she's a good thing, too, but it works out, man.
You'll be all right.
I got your back.
Here, walk around.
You know what I'm saying? Walk around.
You know what I mean? Just do something.
Some days, I'm Uncle Situation.
Other days, I'm Dr.
Situation.
I'm Chef Situation.
Bang your girl situation, I mean, you know, I'm just, uh, I'm like a A pretty deep dude.
You do Ronnie.
You take care of Ronnie.
You go to the gym.
Listen to music, vibe out.
You know, that's what we're gonna do.
I'm good as hell when it comes to relationships, man.
Listening to Mike about relationship problems is like listening to a sailor about flying a plane.
Life goes on, man, you know what I mean? No matter what.
Time keeps ticking.
And if you don't keep going, you get left behind.
You know, if it's meant to be, it's meant to be.
Life's not cookie cutter.
I'd rather die standing than live on my knees.
You know? That's a [bleep] good one.
[Laughing] That's a good one.
I mean, what am I gonna say to him, you know? I could just tell him to put on a little Michael Bolton.
Here.
Come on, you're gonna be all right.
A little fetal position action.
[Bleep], he'll be okay.
But Sam's not coming back this summer.
I missed you.
I have never been so hurt in my entire life.
I'm destroyed right now, and the best thing for me to do is, you know, go home and hug my mom.
And just sit down in, like, a quiet house and just feel better about myself.
Pretty much, I got in a fight with Ron, and all my stuff was destroyed.
What do you mean, destroyed? - What kind of a fight? - Like, my glasses are broke.
All sunglasses ruined.
- Leave my [bleep]! - [Bleep bleep], you [bleep] bitch.
Enough's enough! Hey! Stop! - Oh, I'm not liking that at all.
- I have no glasses right now.
Mentally, like, I feel like I've been abused.
And I'm gonna have three girls in this [bleep] bed tonight! I'm gonna [bleep] [bleep] out of every [bleep], you stupid bitch! - I never, ever - I don't even [bleep] like you! That's why I cheated on you in Miami! - I'm not healthy, and that's why I'm here.
- No, you're not, and you're not healthy, and that's not a healthy relationship.
Loving somebody, you don't treat each other like that.
That's right.
There's no happiness that's not meant to be.
Right? Come here.
Give me a hug.
I love Ron.
I care for him so much.
But I can't I don't know how I let somebody, like, abuse me that way.
I don't know how I do that.
I hate to see you upset.
There's truth out there but I can't seem to find it I'm drunk, I'm stoned, I may be misguided some things that are wrong can't be right What'd she say to you guys? She's coming back? Not to our knowledge, no.
Think she kind of feels like you do all this stuff to her, and then she just stays.
Yeah As a woman, I'd probably leave too.
- I would have.
- Oh, yeah.
Girls are different than guys.
Yeah, that's what we're looking at it as like a woman.
I [bleep] up, huh? For her to have that big of a decision to leave like that, like, yeah.
I feel like I destroyed the relationship.
Did you want the relationship? Like, you know, I've definitely realized that I lost something good now.
And it's like Don't give me dirty looks, Snook***.
I'm not on Ron's side.
I'm on Sam's side.
And I don't want to be a part of this anymore because it's so [bleep] annoying.
I don't even want to go upstairs.
I don't even want to sleep upstairs to be honest with you.
I, like, wanna break down.
[Sighs] I don't even know what to say.
All right, I'm gonna go.
- [Snickering] - You do that.
- What the hell? - That ain't right, bro.
One, two, three, four, I declare a prank war.
Aah! [Laughing] My croc! Sam's stuff's gone.
- You didn't touch it, right? - Mm-mmm.
Either she came and got her stuff, or somebody's [bleep] with me.
We forgot a [bleep] bag.
You okay? No.
If you need anything, Paul is here for you.
- [Chuckles] - Just gotta give it time.
- You know? - Hey, you have the right to be upset for as long as you want.
- You ready? - [Whispers] Okay.
Let's make fun of tonight.
I miss Sammi.
Everyone's in a [bleep] mood.
And Ronnie's just, like, toxic.
So we decide, yo, let's throw cake in Vinny's hair.
You distract him.
Talk to him on the couch.
I'll take the cake.
Hi.
Yo, guess what.
[Whispering] I'll tell you a secret.
You wanna know something funny? What? [Laughing] Yes! [Laughing] Team meatballs one, bromance zero.
Ah, that ain't right, bro.
What just happened? These girls don't realize what they just did.
They just started a prank war.
[Chuckling] That was the worst thing that they could have ever done.
I know.
In their life.
Where do I go? Hide underneath the bed.
[Dog barking] Do not prank me.
I have brains.
You can put Deena and Nicole's brains together and their brain still wouldn't equal mine.
But just so they sleep like babies Toni [Bleep].
What happened? - You just got yourself? - [Laughing] Yeah.
What a rookie, bro.
I remember when you used to be good at prank wars, dog.
I say you go straight-up gangsta and grab one of them [bleep] pads that are in the garbage full of [bleep].
Put it underneath their pillow.
[Laughing] Yo! One, two, three, four, I declare a prank war.
Look at that little guy.
- Oh, that's a good one.
- Little hershey kiss.
Ugh.
Put some holes in it, though, so it airs it out.
[Pop] All right, that's good.
Ooh, yeah, [bleep].
These girls are dead.
Yeah, there you go.
Perfect.
That'll be there for weeks.
[Laughs] Yeah, buddy! Good, I know where it is, you [bleep].
I'm here, bitches.
I see it! So as soon as they go out, I run out of the bed, I get it, and I put it under Vinny's pillow.
And it was kind of like, "karma's a bitch, baby!" Like, "joke's on you.
" [Laughing] [Soft rock music] [snickers] Sorry there, man.
- [Indistinct] What the hell? - Oh, it stinks.
[Laughing] Oh, my God, what stinks? I'm gonna check on my [bleep].
[Sniffs] That's it, this is war.
And I'm gonna fight back.
And I'm gonna win.
[Chuckling] Look what I got.
I find Nicole's most prized possession, her crocodilly that she sleeps with every night, and cuddles with under the covers.
And I take crocodile, to prank Nicole back for what she did to me.
Close your mouth, now speak of something, baby you're the one, baby, meet your demise you're the one, baby, meet your demise you're the one, baby, meet your demise oh, Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, all in the sky take the last train to mosel and I'll bet your heart's still racing you've been feeling very good, my love in current situations uhh Did you throw it over? [Yawns] Where's crocodilly? He's missing! I'm gonna cry.
Did you take crocodilly? Did you take her crocodile? Nah, I didn't take anybody's crocodile.
Don't look at me.
Maybe I misplaced it somewhere.
[Laughing] Croc? Croc? Croc! I want Nicole to suffer.
I want Nicole to, you know, look outside, to call her friend, to call the casino pier and see if she left it on the ride, you know? - Mike, did you steal crocodilly? - I swear, baby, I was sleeping.
But I seen somebody running with it.
- Really? - For real.
Where? I feel bad right now.
You know, poor Snooks is running around and her green stuffed animal is missing.
And, you know what? Snooks is never gonna find that.
I saw somebody hang croc.
No! [Scary music] Aah! Croc! [Laughing] Oh, my gosh.
[Screams] Who does that to this innocent Little thing? Who hung crocodilly? Whose face did you throw cake in? [Laughing] Vinny! - How'd you know it was up there? - Mike.
What the hell is wrong with this kid? Why would he blow why would he blow me up? I don't know.
Mike, family meeting! Yo, why in the world would you tell her you saw me - walking out with her green thing? - Oh, I didn't say you.
- I said I saw somebody.
- Well, why would you do that? You ruined the whole prank, bro.
Oh, you and the smarmy little pranks, dude.
I didn't say it was you.
I didn't say it was you.
But you told her it was upstairs.
It could have went on for [bleep] For a day.
Yeah, I didn't I didn't know the seriousness of the the missing crocodile.
- Okay.
- Didn't know the seriousness.
I was I was sleeping.
I wasn't a part of it.
I didn't know how serious the missing crocodile was.
I'm sorry.
I mean, honestly, Vinny, it was a pretty lame prank to begin with.
I mean, come on, heh, it's not Defcon Five right now.
If I saw you doing something, [laughing] And and she asked me, - I'd be like, "yo, I have no idea.
" - No, I I was like, "what crocodile?' - exactly.
- Yo, his name isn't Sitch anymore.
It's "snitchuation," yo.
- [Laughter] - "Snitchuation.
" It is, uh [Laughter] I have to take a crap.
I've unplugged toilet bowls in my life before, you know, I'm not an idiot.
[Laughing] What are you doing? - Come on! - Ew! Hey, baby.
I see an ex from back in the day.
Yo, look at Mike.
And then Mike grabs her and starts talking to her.
Wow.
[Whispering] Ron.
It's, like, 9:45.
Sleeping without Sam, I felt weird.
You know, I felt like I missed the person that I loved the most next to me.
I was so nervous having to go up and wake up Ronnie.
[Creaking] Did either of you use the bathroom, just like That was actually Ronnie.
He clogged the upstairs one and he clogged that one.
Now that one won't flush.
- Which one won't flush? - All three of 'em.
I have to take a crap.
The toilet is clogged because I live with farm animals.
That one just backed everything up.
Uhh, there's corn in it! My bathroom toilet bowl is probably filled with tampons, paper towels, toilet bowl rolls.
These people just don't give a [bleep].
So I'm doing every trick in the book to unplug this toilet bowl.
[Laughing] What are you doing? *** Eww.
I've unplugged toilet bowls in my life before.
You know, I'm not an idiot.
Come on! [Laughing] This is [bleep].
But after a while of hard battling against the toilet, I just give up.
It's not going down.
- It's not, right? - Need a plumber.
What's up with Ronnie? It looks like he's gonna kill someone.
Sammi went home last night.
They had a huge fight and she left? - The fight couldn't have been that bad.
- Beds getting thrown.
Clothes over the railing.
Oh, my God.
I was scared.
Ronnie is a fricking hot mess, and this is not what we thought was gonna happen at all.
Andit's just sad to watch.
Oh, my God, I have to poop so bad.
Who is in the bathroom? [Ronnie crying] I really don't know at this point I don't know what to do.
Gonna totally turd in my pants.
[Crying] With Sam, it's like I love being around her.
Like, I'm at work, and I want to come home to her.
Ugh.
Ron's crying in the bathroom right now.
And he just needs to get out, because I really have to go.
Ronaldo! Ah.
Oh, thank God.
The bathroom is free.
[Giggles] I'm good.
I feel bad for him, 'cause now he's hurting, but he should be hurting for what he did to her.
Yo, he told me yesterday, he's like, "yo, I wanna leave.
I don't wanna be here no more.
" I said, "yo, man, then you need to you know, man up.
" What's he gonna do right here now with himself? He won't be single Ronnie.
- You don't think so? - Nah, hell no.
When we're m.
V.
P.
, we're out grabbing chicks, what's he gonna do, sit at the bar? Hey, if he's crying in the corner, that pretty much is gonna be our [bleep] block the whole night.
We don't have single Ronnie right now.
- So we lost both.
- Yeah.
- So there's no point.
- That's the way I look at it.
Ron is just really [bleep] up right now.
And we needed to come together and figure out a strategy to help him.
What are we gonna do about Ron? [Sighs] Let's go, handsome.
I'm gonna start calling guys hunks.
He's hurting.
He should feel like she's gone.
We decided to move Sam's stuff down to our room, so Ron doesn't have to see all her [bleep] and think about her.
Should we start collecting her stuff? I don't know.
It's good for him, though.
It's good for him.
He's got it has to go down like this.
We get our haircuts at 3:30.
Then that's it.
- Ronnie, you're a hunk today.
- Yeah, you're such a hunk.
- Sorry.
- Can you get on that real quick? - Okay.
- [Dialing phone] I'd like to place an order for two dozen roses.
Yeah, one's birthday, for Nikki, and the one's, uh, for Samantha.
I feel like I owe Sam an apology, and I can't do it, 'cause she's not in the house, and I don't want to call her, so I send her flowers, and then I send her sister flowers, 'cause it's her birthday.
Today we'll do red Tomorrow, pink, and then Saturday, white.
Would you like to add a balloon, a Teddy bear, or a chocolate with it? All three.
[Scoffs] Let's roll out of here.
Let's just go.
Hey, we're going to get our haircuts.
I don't know if you want to come.
- Haircuts? - Yeah, buddy.
We gotta leave for haircuts.
The keys are right there.
The boys have to physically take Ronnie and move him out of the house so the girls can do their thing.
As bad as it looks Where can we store it? We decide to move Sam's stuff down to our room, because, if she comes back, Sammi needs to be with us.
Here, throw this in it too.
Ew, something stinks.
Right? Like, right here.
No, one over here was - [Laughing] Oh, no.
- No, just - it was dirty drawers, wasn't it? - Just let it go.
Just let it go.
- What I just threw to you.
- Yeah, just let it go.
[Laughing] Oh, my God.
I just picked up dirty underwear! I mean, this here is a grenade-free zone right now.
At this particular time, I'm holding up Ronnie, because I gotta get [bleep] done, man.
I'm the situation.
- Let's go, Pedro, let's knock it out.
- I gotta get my eyebrows done, man.
It's a process to be a situation.
Not everybody can do it.
At the barber shop, we plan on taking as long as we can just to keep Ronnie out of the house.
There's classes of grenades.
It goes, like, grenade, grenade launcher, and then the submarine.
After the submarine, there's the tank.
Then there's the scud, right? And then, after the tank, it's the a -bomb.
When he asks where did all her stuff go, should we just say I don't know.
That's why I want to hurry, because they're gonna be home soon.
What time is it? The boys are home.
All right, relax.
Just spent the last two years of my life cleaning.
Keep it that way! Uh, when I get back from my haircut, Sam's stuff's gone.
Coming home and not seeing anything, I'm like, "[bleep], she's gone for good.
" She forgot the rest of her stuff.
That doesn't make sense.
Either she came home while nobody was home and got her stuff and she's not coming back, or somebody's [bleep] with me.
[Bleep], we forgot a [bleep] bag.
Ahem, you guys moved her stuff? - Hello? - Sam? I hear, "oh, hey, Sam.
" Then she gets all quiet.
Well, he's right here.
- Hi, we found something.
- What? - Eww.
- Eww! - Ohh.
- Ohh! [Bleep], we forgot a [bleep] bag.
Ahem, you guys moved her stuff? I just got home from my friend's.
I just cleaned.
Upstairs? No, look it.
When I asked the girls what happened, right away, "I don't know.
I didn't touch it.
I didn't know anything.
" [Thud] You didn't touch her [bleep], right? - Mm-mmm.
- [Indistinct] I realize that I lied to Ron's face, but, you know, guys have to stick with guys and girls have to stick with girls.
[Dialing phone] Hello? Sam It's Jenni.
What's up? Hello? Jenni's on the phone, and I hear, "oh, hey, Sam.
" Then she gets all quiet.
Is something going on? No, no, no.
He's Right there.
I mean, obviously, the girls take Sam's side.
They're like, they got their little girl code.
Three weeks ago, there was no girls, you know what I mean? It's like, you can't all of a sudden develop some girl code.
Here.
You forgot the rest of her stuff.
I want to talk to you, but I have to go to work with Vinny.
All right.
Bye.
I think the girls took Sam's stuff downstairs, and I think they should mind their business.
They should only get involved if it affects them.
Right now, I don't trust anybody in that house.
What'd she say? I really couldn't talk to her.
I mean, I saw Ronnie, and I didn't want Ronnie to know I was talking to her.
And then Ronnie gave me her bag, and I was like, "ah, [bleep].
" I was like, "I just gotta go to work," but It's very weird.
Very weird.
I wanna do rides.
Yeah, we're going on the go-karts.
All of us.
- Tickets.
Tickets.
- Get outta here.
- I.
D.
- I'm just kidding.
Shorts skirt's too short.
Don't tell me what to do.
Can I reach the pedal? Oh, my God, I really can't reach.
Yeah, buddy.
[Go-karts puttering] Oh, my God! Aah! [Laughter] Aah! I'm falling! [Bleep] Jersey drivers! Yeah, I love it! Oh, my [bleep] stomach.
- Are you okay? - No.
You're still coming out right? - If I feel like this, no.
- No? I start getting, like, really bad stomachache.
And I'm like I'm backed up.
Maybe once I go to the bathroom, I'll feel better.
Have a coffee.
Then it'll flow out of your butthole like frickin' rainstorm.
- We have to get these toilets fixed.
- I know.
[Duck quacking] - Hello? - Hey, Ron, how are ya? I just wanted to say thank you.
- That was really nice of you.
- You're welcome.
Nikki called me to thank me for the flowers.
Sisters are always gonna have sisters' backs, and I'm afraid that she's gonna give me a lot of [bleep].
And I know Samantha says thank you, too, for Her flowers, but she's not here right now.
- All right, no problem.
- Yes, I am.
All right, well, I hope you have a good birthday.
- Hello? - Said I hope you have a good birthday.
No, it's me.
I'm just like, "uh" I don't even know what to say.
Hello? I can't hear anything.
All you guys do is fight.
This is between me and my girlfriend, and I'm gonna handle it between us.
You two are [bleep] u in the head, and you both need to be single.
.
Do you wanna drink more, or do you wanna play? I see this kid Snooki brings home.
This is the kid that [bleep] blocked me with his uncle.
- We gotta go up there like we're his uncles.
- I'll kick the door [bleep] in right now.
- Hello? - I said, I hope you have a good birthday.
No, it's me.
Nikki called me, and immediately Sam grabs the phone.
And I'm just like, "uh" Hello? I can't hear anything.
- Hello? - Yes.
Hey, well, you're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.
- What? - I said I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.
- All right, bye.
[Clears throat] I definitely think, at this point, me and Sam need a break.
I don't want to fight with her.
I don't want to argue with her.
I don't know what to think anymore.
[Sighs] Oh, my God.
I'm in the bathroom getting fresh to death, as I do, and I see these disgusting panties.
And I'm like, "well, who the hell's panties are these?" So I'm like, "I need to investigate this.
" How you supposed to get fresh in the bathroom with some dirty-ass drawers that belong to somebody in this house.
- Whose are those? - I have no idea.
So gross.
Nasty.
- Eww.
- Is that gross? - That's nasty.
- What is? Somebody got some dirty drawers, girl.
It's not mine.
Whose are they? - Ew, don't - I don't know.
Then you they're yours, - 'cause you touched 'em.
- No, I did not.
They're not mine.
I would never wear those.
You know they're not Snook's.
There's no bronzer on 'em.
I'm glad I got a penis, man.
Let me tell you.
I'm glad I got a [bleep].
Yo, you wanna g.
T.
F.
? Gym, tan, find out whose underwear those are? [Laughter] - Hi.
We found something.
- Hi, guys.
Both: What? Dirty drawers.
Ew.
- Eww! Whose are they? - [Laughing] I don't know.
- Ohh! - They were in our bathroom.
They were in our downstairs bathroom.
And I need your help to help me find out whose they are.
Mike, somebody got some dirty drawers, dog.
Ohh, those are Deena's.
Those your Those are not mine.
I never wear underwear like that.
- They're not mine.
Mine's are red.
- I make sure my [bleep] clean.
I got them same ones, except mine's are red.
All right, since we don't know who they are, can somebody get them out of the house? 'Cause that's gross.
Blah! Yo, that's the grossest thing I've seen in my life.
They're obviously one of the girls' in this house.
Huh-uh, what about one of those, uh Oh, I don't know.
Maybe it could have been one of their girls.
None of my girls changed down there.
I honestly think it's one of the girls that the guys bring home.
The girls I bring home wear no underwear.
Or they take 'em off in the bathroom.
Yeah, they take 'em off in the bathroom.
[Laughter] Oh, gross.
[All laughing] What the hell Goes on in this house? [Laughter] [Screaming] Can I have a cab in seaside? - Where are you going? - To karma.
- All right, we'll be there.
- All right.
I wear the right shoes so I can outrun everyone I got the right moves like an earthworm in the sun Wow, Mike's ready.
I gotta get sharp I look like trailer trash.
To the best part oh, my God, that's the feeling when the feeling is gone Right now, I don't feel good.
You didn't [bleep] yet? Oh, damn.
Deena's friggin' constipated right now.
So she needs some roughage in her diet.
But she needs to switch up something.
Your nickname, the blast, is gonna give a new name to it later.
- Ew.
- [Laughter] - Couple dance moves, soon as you - If she Jersey turnpiked, - i it would be the end.
- [Laughter and groans] She'd be like.
- [Raspberry] - Ohh.
You'll clear out a circle for us.
- [Laughing] Shut the [bleep] up.
- Let's do it.
You know what? I hate this.
I'm, like, having a bad time.
You're the one that brings it up.
I feel like everybody kind of gets on me a lot, because I'm new and they say I have to get hazed, and all this stuff.
She's mad now.
Stop.
- M.
P.
D.
- Dude, she shouldn't be.
She's like, "I'm open, I don't care, I'll speak about it.
" Then you're gonna get blasted.
I'm over it now, though.
Like, just let me be.
- The cab is here! - [Laughter] Let's get it started hey, let's, let's get started now's the time, everyone let's grab our things and go then we'll meet in the street that's where we'll start the show one, two, three, four just leave your worries at the door 'cause now you're here, you're at the show and that is all you need to know - How ya doing? - Hi, baby.
- How ya been? - I see a friend from home.
- Vinny, this is Gina.
- Gina, how are you? She happens to be an ex from back in the day.
And I'm like, "wow, it's great to see somebody from back home in seaside.
" - Man, I'm glad you came.
- Wait, do I know you? When do you go back to Boston, Saturday? I think we're leaving here Saturday, going to a.
C.
, staying in a.
C.
Yo.
And then Mike grabs her and starts talking to her.
Yo, look at Mike.
Mike just has no guy code whatsoever.
Like, he'll pull a robbery on your own ex-girlfriend.
Wow.
I can take you home with me.
I'm not like that.
Girls that I make my girlfriends are smart enough chicks not to fall for situation's [bleep].
So my ex-girl Gina, she told me right away.
She's like, "yo, Mike tried to take me home.
" That's situation.
To be at karma right now without Sam, it's feels weird.
Like, you know, I feel like I'm floating around, like my real friend isn't here.
So it's kind of awkward.
Ronnie is so upset that Sam is not here.
He's not acting himself.
He's just pretty much depressed, and I've never seen Ron this upset, ever.
Are you okay? You having fun? I miss her A lot.
I'm gonna be honest with you right now, and don't hate me for it.
But you said a lot of [bleep] up [bleep] to her, and she deserves to feel like that, and she deserves to go home and be with her family.
But I'll get her back.
How? I'll figure it out.
I will, though.
'Cause I get what I want.
Dude, my honest opinion You two shouldn't be together.
I don't believe that, Snook.
I don't believe it.
Ron, his frickin' motto in life is "deny, deny, deny.
" And he just needs to admit that it's over.
Good-bye.
Dude, you two are [bleep] up in the head, and you both need to be single.
And I'll probably be the only one in the house to tell you that.
You're better people without each other.
I'm just telling Snook, "you don't know what you're talking about.
"This is between me and my girlfriend.
"Or ex-girlfriend.
"And I'm gonna [bleep] handle it between us.
I'm not playing this - All you guys do is fight.
- That's not true.
You guys are like talking to a frickin' wall, and I'm done trying.
- Ow! - Oh, busted! Deena turns into the sloppopotamus.
[Overlapping chatter] Let her breathe, let her breathe.
I wanna go home.
A slop tart and a hippopotamus put together.
I feel like I'm a joke.
- Got something for you.
- I don't want it.
Get out.
It's a sick burger, son.
- Get out.
- I know you want it.
I think he's really waiting for me to ask him, "here, Mike, you wanna give her a go?" You know.
Just one full bite and I'll leave.
One full bite and I'll leave.
[Upbeat music] Deena, get it, girl! - I love single Jenni.
- Oh, yay! I'm always, like, on the hunt for girls.
I'm always looking around.
I wanna go get a drink.
Come with me.
This girl walks in.
Her name is Kristin.
She catches my eye.
And I'm actually into her.
So why not just hang out with her, you know? I'm set.
Grenade.
Grenade.
Oh, complete grenade.
Karma is getting boring.
It's packed with grenades.
And I wanna meet, like, hot gorilla juice heads.
Tell me what you want, I've heard the worst yet give me a track and I'm killin' 'em I just spent a couple stacks on a brand-new purse there's bottles in the room and I'm poppin' 'em first I meet this little Mario brother.
It was kind of like a last resort.
Like walking out of the club.
"Okay, you're coming with me.
" Because, you know, I'm drunk, and I just wanna hook up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, get going - Hey, let's go! - Well, you don't even know my you don't even remember my name.

Whoo! Gianni.
Holla.
- His name is Gianni.
- I know, that's my I can't walk.
Everything is shaking.
Can I pop a squat behind the taxi? Yo, ask Deena if she took a [bleep] yet.
Girl was constipated.
Listen, we'll go straight to the bathroom.
- No.
- Just let it out, girl.
No, I don't even have to go.
What's your name, Gianni? - [Impatient] Yes.
- Okay, ass [bleep].
Mike, carry me.
Am I heavy? [Laughs] No.
My boobs are, like, 20 pounds.
Aah! I gotta pee! Your butt's bouncing on my [bleep].
I'm going home because everybody is annoying me.
- Stop being tostitos right now.
- No, I'm going home.
Stop being tostitos.
- Ow! - Oh, busted! Deena fell! Deena fell! [Crying] I wanna go home.
I miss my friends.
- Deena - No, no one gets it, I wanna Deena, we love you, you idiot.
- Come on.
- No, no one loves me.
- I want to go home! - On, no, let her breathe.
- 'Cause nobody gets me.
- I get you, no, no.
No one gets me.
No one gets me.
Let her breathe.
Let her breathe.
Deena turns into the sloppopotamus.
The combination of a slop tart and a hippopotamus put together.
The sloppa sloppa sloppotapatus? Let's play! - Talk to her! - You can make it.
- She is upset with you.
- What is she upset Let's play! Come on, grab a burger.
- No, I no grab yeah.
- No, Deena.
Deena, just grab two.
Look at me.
Listen to me.
We're only fooling around, Deena.
No, but the thing is, you guys think you can fool around with me always.
- We're fooling around! - And, like, you know what, - sometimes it hurts my feelings.
- DeenaDeena, look at me.
- I feel like I'm a joke.
- Help me out.
Help me cook.
Come on, let's go.
- Stop.
Look at me, Deena.
- No, they think, like, I'm kidding.
Do you want to go home, Deena? Look at me.
Listen, listen.
Don't let anybody get you down.
No matter what.
I'm down worse than you are.
And I'm giving you a pep talk right now.
I usually have thick skin, but, like, ugh.
Just get we're picking on you.
You're like our baby sister that we never wanted.
I'm gonna [bleep], no matter what.
I'm gonna [bleep] rip your [bleep] Teddy bear that you love.
That's what I'm gonna do.
You're getting way too serious.
All right? I think it was cool that Ronnie really did make me feel better.
He's like a brother to me, Ronnie, now.
So get me some [bleep] buns that are in the bread [bleep] cabinet.
I want ketchup and [bleep] mustard, right [bleep] now.
- All right, all right.
- Okay? This is no propane.
This is done.
- Are you running? - No.
Do you wanna drink more or do you wanna play? I haven't had sex in, like, four months.
Right now, I need to be smushing.
Let's claim the smush room.
I get Gianni up to the smush room like that.
[Laughs] Run.
Whoo! I don't like that.
I see this kid Snooki brings home, and I'm like "Wait a minute.
"This is the kid that [bleep] blocked me with his Uncle.
" This is my sister's beautiful daughter, and I need to pick her up.
All right.
- [Laughing] - You have to leave? I guess so.
That's the kid that busted in with his Uncle.
We gotta go up there like we're his Uncle.
Dude, I'll kick the door [bleep] in right now.
[Laughs] We gotta do it.
He tried to clown me with his Uncle.
So guess what, bro you're in my house.
We're gonna clown you.
- Busted big-time! - Both: Yeah.
*** - Whoo! - Yo, you know who that kid is? That's the kid that busted in with his Uncle.
We gotta go up there like we're his Uncle.
I'll kick the door [bleep] in right now.
Yo.
I gotta take my girl out of the room right now.
- Gotta go.
- You know what I mean? - My niece gotta go.

[Bleep].
- My niece gotta go.
- No, we [bleep].
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, [bleep], girl! [Laughter] I don't know why the guys are being [bleep] blocks right now.
All I know is I haven't got it in in, like, four months.
So the fact that I have a boy and he wants to get it in, please, let me live.
I have no idea what this kid's name is.
So might as well just give him an ugly name.
[Giggles] Whah! - They're perfect eggs.
- Cheese on 'em now.
Yeah! Vinny gets a burger.
Vin dog! Where you at? - I got something for you.
- I don't want it.
Get out.
- It's a sick burger, son.
- Get out.
I know you want it.
You and your girl can split it.
I think Mike will try to look for leftovers.
I think he's really waiting for me to ask him, "here, Mike, you wanna give her a go?" - [Laughs] You know.
- Have your girl take a bite.
- [Laughing] No! - Come on, get out.
Just one full bite and I'll leave.
One full bite and I'll leave, for real.
Take a big joint.
There we go.
- You want some pickle? - No.
Little pickle.
I'll leave in a sec.
Take more pickle.
There you go, big dog.
I take care of my boys.
You want a drink, dog, real quick? - No, I'm good.
- You sure? [Laughing] It dripped on my neck.
You okay? I feel bad for Ronnie, 'cause you could tell he's, like, distraught.
I didn't know you were gonna be like this.
I'm gonna tell you.
We moved her stuff.
Her stuff is downstairs.
- You see? - I really do like Ronnie as a person.
And I felt bad lying to him.
I felt bad kind of betraying him.
*** her stuff downstairs because *** I appreciate that.
- But - That's like I'm thankful to Deena, you don't even know me that well, as I know these guys for a year, and they wouldn't say anything.
I realized that *** because she feels - embarassed - she crushed me, destroyed me - crushed - I'm embarassed, too.
*** Don't cry.
I'm not Okay.
*** myself so better here.
You think you're gonna leave also? *** I can't put *** go out, drink as much as I want *** myself more and more.
I am embarassed know my actions, and at this point I just want to go home.
Don't leave, bro.
I know it's better for me.
Just like that was what she needed and that's what I need.
This is now worth without her.
- *** - What? I think *** having a really good time right now, I'm sorry *** maybe starting to feel what ***.
Can you call a cab really quick? - I'll call a cab ***.
- Oh, Mike.
- Taxi.

Okay, don't be an ass[Bleep].

Yo, you know who that kid is? That's the kid that busted in with his Uncle.
We gotta go up there.

Poo-poo pillow.

I declare a prank war.
Aah! My croc! - How'd you know it was up there? - Mike.
Yo, his name isn't sitch anymore.
It's snitch-uation, yo.
- [Laughter] - Snitch-uation.
[Crying] I can't do this anymore.
I need to go home and Get myself together.
I can't be around Ron anymore.
The best thing for me to do is go home and be done with the whole thing.
As a woman, I'd probably leave too.
I feel like I don't have anybody in this house.
You think you're gonna leave also? [Get crazy by lmfao] Dj pauly delvecchio! I'm going to the Jersey shore, bitch! All right, we got a situation.
I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
[Laughing] After I have sex with a guy I will rip their heads off.
Go Vinny! Go Vinny! You like the boobs? Do something crazy [Hip-hop music] - Spoon me.
- What do you mean? Can you not be the worst snuggler ever? Want me to go? Yeah, sure.
Leave.
Bye.
If you don't wanna cuddle, thanks for the bragole, but no dinner dates with me and you.
Good-bye.
Never see you again.
- I had sex last night.
- What? Is that why you got the condom from me? My vagina's killing me.
Do you have a number, or is he one one done? [Laughing] On to the next.
[Bleep] That.
- Nick's hotter.
No offense.
- Yeah, he is.
[Dialing] [Line rings] - Hello? - Hey, it's Nicole.
- Yo, what's going on? - Nick was, like, the perfect guy.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Gorilla, sexy.
You know, hot, muscley.
So why not just, you know, give it another try with Nick? - What are you doing tonight? - Why, what you got plans? Well, I was wondering if you wanted to, like, get together.
All right.
You want to call me, then, around, like, 4:30? Are you gonna answer? Yes, I'll be waiting for you around that time.
- All right, bye.
- Good-bye.
Is it me, or does he sound ghetto? We got work, pimp.
I'm not trying to get fired, dog! Get it! We have work, deena! Get your weiner cleaner! Deena! Let's go! - An all-star staff here today.

[Cranking] You're the boss.
Deena, you're doing nothing.
Thank you.
Go on the floor and bring me a sale.
- Please.
- I'm hung over.
I'm not having a good time.
Work blows [Bleep] for skittles right now.
I wanna kill myself.
- What do you wanna do? - I don't know.
You want a ride? Um Yo, we're bouncin' for a second for our break - to get a cup of ice cream.
- I wanna go.
Deena's still sleeping.
Look at her.
Yo, do you wanna just stay out for just like an hour and then blame it on me? I like where your head's at, girl! [Dial tone, dialing] [Line ringing] - Yo.
- What are you doing? - What's going on, Ron? - I need someone to talk to.
I definitely think I need my dad, because he's been through a lot of [Bleep] In his life.
And I need somebody that understands what I'm going through.
Just feel like I've made too many bad decisions at this point.
I need to fix it.
I'm not gonna fix it here.
I need you or [Bleep] My friends.
I need people that understand me.
You want me to come down, I come down tonight, bro.
I can get down there like an hour and a half, - no problem.
- All right.
- All right, bye.
- Bye-bye.
What up, man? How do you win that bike right there? Three in a row.
Three wins for a prize.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
All right.

Instead of reacting off your gut and stuff.

So I was ready to leave, 'cause I'd rather have nothing and [Bleep] Ten years of being with her than to have everything and [Bleep] Have no peace of mind and just be so Twisted in the head.
I know right now it feels very painful.
It hurts like hell, and it feels like it's never gonna go away.
And we've all been through that, but You can do it, bro.
Now that she's not here, then you'll have some time, I guarantee you It'll get better, you know.

Don't give up.
What are you gonna do? - Just stick it out.
- Yeah, right? If I feel like in a couple of days The next time you feel like you want to, just pick up the phone and call me.
My father definitely talked me off the ledge at this point.
I was ready to jump and, I think, make a big mistake.
But, uh, he's definitely given me the strength to just stick it out.
- Okay? - I love you.
- I love you too.
- Thank you.
Give me a call.
Let me know.

What's going on right now?" [Laughing] I'm so stressed out right now.
He didn't answer at all? What if he hooked up with one of his friends last night? - Oh, my God.

The toilet's still [Bleep] Clogged up.
And, you know, it's actually pretty friggin' disgusting.
- Did you take a [Bleep] Yet? - Yeah, did today.
- Good.

Me and this toilet is like a boxing match.
Like, we keep going rounds with each other.
I got knocked out in the first round, so I'm going back at it.
Why does it wind back up? Pauly! Yo, pauly, do you know how to use that [Bleep] Thing? Nah, no idea.
I'm not from around here.
Can we call a plumber? Ah, well, Danny probably knows how, but I just want to get the toilet bowl unclogged at this point.
Oh, [Bleep] This [Bleep].
I'm usually pretty good at clearing out pipes and laying down the pipe.
But, uh When it comes to unclogging this toilet, I just can't hang.
[Bleep] This.
[Bleep].
Can't do anything right.
- Vin, do you wanna bang? - What? Will you still have sex with me? I cannot believe that you had sex with that kid.
- Well, I take it back.
- I can't believe it.
I take it back.
I'm so pissed that I [Bleep] Up my date with Nick.
And now Vinny doesn't even give me the time of day.
Don't feel bad.
- Was the sex good? - No, wasn't even worth it.
What the hell? The kid's shorter than you.
Great.
[Crowd shouting] Hi, I ordered a cab to 1209 ocean terrace.
It never came.
A few minutes? All right, bye.
Yo, Vinny, did you know that dude [Bleep, bleep] Snooks? He [Bleep] Your [Bleep] Last night? What is it with dudes meeting girls for the first time and [Bleep]? You need a background check, social security number, how much she's making a year.

- She's been to jail! - I'm over Vinny.
- She's not mad at me.
She's mad at me.
Vinny really pisses me off, 'cause he's the one who always brings home grenades.
So I'm doing me.
He should be proud of that.
Nicole! Can't hear you.
Bye, not listening.
I know you don't want me to call you, but But I just, like, wanted to hear your voice, you know? I can't keep it inside anymore.
I gotta give Sam a call.
What about us? - I think you put me through a lot.
- I was wrong for everything.
I always knew what I had, and, like, you didn't.
If she comes back, I can't be in the same house with her.
He's gonna try and win you over with, "oh, I'm sorry.
I love you.

It's gonna be really hard.

- She's been to jail! - I'm over Vinny.
- Nicole! You're not mad at me, right? - You're a jerk.
- Why? - You're mean.
- I'm not mean.
There's definitely a double standard in the house.
Vinny can hook up with all these grenades, but if I bring home guys and only sleep with one of them, like, I'm the biggest slut in the world.
I just don't get why you [Bleep] Rag on me about that [Bleep].
When how many times do you [Bleep, bleep]? We weren't ragging on you.
We were ragging on the guy.
Don't be mean to me like that.
I don't like that.
I want you to hook up and get with guys, but not I just didn't like that kid.
And and I want Good quality guys.
There's no good quality guys in seaside, jerk.
I wasn't ragging on you.

And that's when I'm starting to think, "like, okay, maybe he's starting to feel what I've been feeling.
" Feel my pulse You're a prostitute? - Yeah.
- Oh, I love it.
She knows Roger.
- She knows Roger? - You guys know Roger? - I know Roger.
- Yeah, we do.
Yeah.
So what? Were you seeing Roger? - Yeah.
- Yeah? What happened? - You guys - He's in Maine.
It's been almost a week since I've seen Roger, and I'm kind of missing him.
I can't wait to see him when he comes home.
- Is that your friend? - Yeah, very good friend.
Oh, I I'm head over heels for him.
And when he comes back, are you still seeing him? I start to realize that He's hitting on me.
You should text him right now and tell him I miss him.
I like where I am with Roger right now.
And I don't want to pull a Nicole with Nick and ruin it by just hooking up with some Joe schmoe.
- What is it, "jwoww"? - Misses you.
I'll be right back.
- I wanna leave! - Yo, you trying to leave? - Party foul? - Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
[Laughing] Whoa! What a good time.
[Laughing] I'm not going in anyone's bed 'cause they're all jerk offs in my house.
- Uses an entire paper towel - Where's Nicole? - Deena, where's Nicole? - Yo, Nicole! Hey, Nicole! Ah, hell, yes.
Wanna cuddle? Vinny didn't bring home a girl, and I didn't bring home a guy.
So I decided to go into Vinny's bed.
'Cause, you know, I love cuddling with Vinny, and he's, like, the best cuddle partner ever.
- [Kiss] - [Indistinct] Come to your bed.
Let's go.
You don't wanna do this.
I'm telling you, I'm gonna carry you there.
- Cuddle with me.
- No, you don't wanna cuddle.
Really? No, stop.
I want to cuddle with you.
No.
When Vinny's sober, he doesn't want to snuggle.
He wants nothing to do with me.
Cool.
Like, make up your mind.
[Chuckling] Okay.
What happened tonight, bro? Vinny and snooki, they have like a weird thing going on where I don't know if they ultimately have feelings for each other.
Whatever, they should just smush and get it over with.
It's just a smush fest, not no feelings.
Snooks is passed out on your bed.
You should [Bleep, bleep], bro.
I'm not smashing her after she [Bleep] banged some kid last night.
I feel you, bro.
I'm not really okay with a guy hooking up with snooki, and then me doing it.
You know, I'm not really with that.
I care about her too much to let her smash two nights.
I'm going to bed.
This relationship's through.
I'm going to bed too.
Well, it's not clear why'd you leave me here alone Hello? - Who is this? - It's me.
What's up? I know you don't want me to call you, but I just, like, wanted to hear your voice, you know? I miss you.
Are you all right? No, I almost left yesterday.
It sounds like you're doing a lot better.
So that's good.
Yeah, I needed this, like, so bad.
You know? Like, really, really bad.
Like, I needed to come home.
What about us? - You put me through a lot.
- I did.
A lot.
I never thought you would ever, like, do that to me.
And you did.
And I was wrong for everything.
But I always knew what I had, and, like, you didn't.
- You're right.
- Now, when I leave, now you realize.
It's not okay.
You know? What if I do come back? Like, we don't have to be together.
I could be your friend.
I can be there for you as a friend, if you need one.
I love Sam, but I don't think I'm gonna be friends with Sam.
You can't move on from life, being friends with somebody that you used to date.
I'm not gonna sit in this house and be your friend.
You're serious? I don't think I could fix myself here.
This isn't isn't the place for me to do it.
Don't ruin your life over me.
Well, you are my life, though, heh.
All right, well, go spend time with your family.
- All right.
- Hopefully I'll see you soon.
- Okay.
- All right, bye.
Okay, bye.
If she comes back, I can't be in the same house with her.
We can't be around each other.
We can't live together.
Can we go? Because it's 6:30.
And I want to eat and take my time.
- Mike, you ready? - I'm ready to leave.
- I don't care.
- Mike, we're leaving.
We took off on Mike.
I'm leaving my home right now, my serenity, to go back into the madness at the Jersey shore.
Hi, Sam.
Can we have a marshmallow fight? Can we stick 'em to the ceiling? [Laughing] We can't do that.
No, you have to do it, like this.
[Laughter] Let's, like, stick 'em to things.
Little treats from the meatballs! Yay, this is fun! Break 'em off.
What a good time.

We're on a short time span.
Mike takes his time on the phone.
Goes upstairs, takes his time.
[Electric razor buzzing] Mike, you ready? Yeah, five minutes.
Oh, I thought you guys left.
Mike, we're leavin'! Three minutes! He's washing his face.
I'm ready to leave.
I don't care.
I need to get out of this house.
Like Let's go.
I'll deal with it.
Don't worry.
We don't wanna wait for Mike anymore.
It's time to teach him a lesson.
So me, Ronnie, and pauly just go eat without him.
Get me the [Bleep] Out of this house, please.
We took off on Mike.
- Are you kidding me? - Alfredo.
I didn't bring my family with me.
I'm gonna enjoy my meal with my housemates.
This pasta is good, vin, right? Yep.
The fact that he pulled that dirty prank, I don't like that.
I don't wanna be friends with you ever again, 'cause you're a [Bleep] Jerk-off.
- Mike, we're leavin'! - Three minutes! We let Mike know three times we were about to leave.
- Go.
Leave him.
- Let's go.
When we say we're leavin', we're leavin'.
Like, "we're leavin' in five minutes," we're leaving in five minutes take us serious.
Know what Gina told me last night? She was like, "yeah, Mike was like, "I know you're Paul's friend and everything, but I'm trying to take you home.
" Yo, look at Mike.
Wow.
- I can take you home with me.
- I'm not like that.
Ah, that's dirty, bro.
I'm really secure, like like, literally, you could spend the whole night with her, but, like, I don't care.
But he asked her to come home.
That's interesting.
Exes, that's like, you don't - Yeah.
- You don't cross that line.
That's been my rule my whole life.
It's like breathing to me, where I wouldn't go near a girl you're [Bleep] With.
Some people aren't like that, I guess.
It's funny to see, though.
- We're still going the right way or no? - Yeah, we're going the right way.
We're having such a good time driving to jenks that we don't realize that we passed the freakin' exit, and we've been in the car for like an hour now.
This is way too long.
I think we need to turn around, bro.
So where the [] Are we going? We're by woodbridge right now! What if Mike said, "bring these girls home?" [Laughing] If that's where you're going, really, turn around.
Can't we just say to turn around? - Hi.
- Where's everyone? - Left.
- They left already? Yeah.
Yeah, that's pretty [Bleep] Up.
I just pulled a really good prank, and now, somehow, somebody decided to pull a little prank on me and leave without the situation.
That doesn't happen.
What are we gonna do? We need to teach these fools a lesson.
- Feel me? - What are you gonna do? Well, now, I'm going to not talk to any of them.
[Laughs] 'Cause I wouldn't have done that, right? No.
Maybe it's just 'cause you took too long? - I don't know.
- Well, listen They knew I was coming.
Regardless, you wait for somebody.
- That's just proper - Common courtesy? Proper etiquette and courtesy.
You agree with me.
Don't say nothin' if you agree with me.
- [Chuckles] - He agrees with me.
See, you would be so happy if I got with your mother, wouldn't you? [Laughs] Are you ready? Let's go get some food.
Is this it? I had a lot of stuff.
[Bleep] Stupid car right now.
- That old green car? - Yeah.
[Honks horn] - [Dog snarls] - No! [Laughing] Feast for me.
Pass the bread, please.
Oh, thank you.
The rest of the house left the situation.
But guess what.
I'm gonna sit down right now.
I'm gonna eat my food and enjoy my meal with my housemates.
This pasta's good, vin, right? Yep.
Oh, my God.
- Are you kidding me? - Here's your Alfredo.
- That's not even a plate.
- I didn't bring my family with me.
- They just took it by - Chicken paradise.
Oh, my God! Rivoli's knows how to feed people.
They give you dishes that would feed the whole, entire house, just for one person.
Oh, my God, and there's sausage inside this []? This is how much pasta I cooked for Sunday dinner last week.
This is bangin' right now.
Bam! [Humming] Hold on, you want some? Nah, I'll eat it.
Mmm, it's good.
So, Ronnie, why you crying all the time? Gotta man up, dog.
A little disappointed in you, pauly.
Bought you a birthday gift.
Always look out for you, dog.
And you bounce.
You cannot have any of my ravioli, Vinny.
You have pink eye! Hey, deena Oh, my bad.
You're in Times Square.
I'm so glad we went out to dinner, guys.
You know what I'm saying? - [Laughing] - [Chuckles] Ohh, Mike.
[Chuckles] I'm leaving my my home right now, my serenity.
To go back into the madness at the Jersey shore.
And I'm thinking to myself, you're ready, you can do this.
I know who you are, Sam.
You're gonna be fine.
Sam.
Hi.
It's not gonna be easy, and we're really Gonna be thinking about you every single day.
'Cause I know it's not gonna be easy.
It's gonna be really hard, but I think I prepared myself.
You know that you need to be strong when you get back, because he's gonna try and win you over with, "oh, I'm sorry.
I love you.
" It's crap, and you know it.
So you have to be seriously strong.
Or I will come, and I will have a talk with him.
For sure.
Being home has made me realize a lot.
I think you grow when you actually have some time to yourself.
All right, let me get goin'.
I feel like I learned, myself, as a person, and what my limits are and what I deserve.
You want us to just leave those? - Leave what? - The flowers.
Yeah, leave 'em.

Dude, I will never talk to that [Bleep] Kid ever again.
- I swear - No, are we [Bleep] There? I swear on a cat's grave that I will never talk to him ever again.
- Cool.
- I am pissed beyond belief! And this is the last straw.
This is [Bleep] Up.
I don't even know what's going on.
And this is not funny anymore.
Where does pauly go for his haircut? - The "baba.
" - Hi, Sam.
Mike booked this.
Dude, I will never talk to that [Bleep] Kid ever again, I swear.
- Are we almost there? - Is that New York City? Where are we going? Where are we going? Where are we going? And in my search I will find that this place isn't right and I'm stuck for all time Did Mike really just send us to the city? Like, I'm done.
Done with Mike! Yeah, well, [Bleep] You, Mike.
We're getting [Bleep] Alcohol and we're getting [Bleep] Up.
Finally decide to do a u-turn and go back to the house.
When I get in the house, I'm gonna tell Mike, "thank you for getting me out of this [Bleep] "[Bleep] Hole-smelling house "and bringing me into this car with this lovely man, "and and [Bleep] A good time.
And a road trip!" Mike thinks he's gonna get over on the meatballs.
But in reality, baby, the meatballs make the best of every situation.
So go screw yourself, Mike.
Bye! Bye, Mike! - See ya.
- See ya later.
I never ate so much food in my whole, entire life.
- Was it good? - It was amazing.
The boys kind of acted a little cowardly when they got home.
They were putting their heads down and trying to avoid me.
They knew they shouldn't have done it.
But, uh, that's just how, you know, the troop's whack without their general, you know? Wow.
[Loud, long burp] [Groans] [Burps] Ooh.
Every time I eat at rivoli's, I wanna die.
As my stomach feels like it's gonna explode, I don't stop eating.
It makes me realize what a gluttonous piece of [Bleep] I am.
[Groans softly] - Food comas? - Jenni.
- Is he mad? - I think so, yeah.
I think he's just sad.
'Cause he's like, "I let Ronnie cry on my shoulder.
"I bought pauly a bike.
So I don't understand why they just do that to me.
" So I was like I don't know.
Mike's real sour when we get home from dinner.
He's like, "you're supposed to be my boys.
" But what it is, is now he can take us serious.
Like when we say we're leaving, we're leaving.
Here, bro, get into this.
[Clatter] - Oh, you guys - There's so much.
You're being nice to me.
You left me, and now you're gonna give me a little bit of fettuccine.
A little bit? There's a lot.
I feel you.
I feel I'm a little pissed at you guys - for bouncing on me today.
- We know.
Yeah, I was like I was pretty pissed.
Heh, I just bought this mother [Bleep] A birthday gift for the [Bleep], and then they bounce on me? Honestly, I was pretty [Bleep] Up.
I'm mad at the boys, also.
I just don't like Vinny lying to me.
I know you don't.
- Vinny's, like, one of my best friends.
- After that, now he has to bang you.
- He has to.
- He has to.
- To win my friendship back.
- Yeah.
Yeah! I will give you a tip, but I'm still kind of mad at you.
We're havin' a good time! Yaaaay! - We went to New York City.
- [Bleep], thank you, Mike! I had such a good time! When we get back to that house, we run in like we had a blast! Like, yeah, I went to the city! Get off of me! [Bleep] You.
You actually made it there, though? Yeah, we went to the city, and we got a drink, - and we clubbed.
- Oh, my God, I had such a So thank you, Mike.
You're an ass [Bleep].
And I don't wanna be friends with you ever again.
'Cause you're a [Bleep] Jerk-off.
- Why, I thought you guys - We did, but the fact that he pulled that dirty prank, I don't like that.
It doesn't make sense.
They had a good time, but they're mad at me.
Deena and snooks have just showed again why they defy the law of intelligence.
I really thought you guys were gonna be able to turn around whenever you wanted, for real.
If you guys are upset, I apologize.
It was only a tiny joke, and you guys were supposed to turn around at the turnpike.
- He did it to be mean! - He's an ass [Bleep].
- No, he didn't.
- Yeah, he did.
Yeah, he did.
Even though it made me very upset, and I almost had an anxiety attack, at the end of the day, it was a good prank.
We need to get him back somehow.
[Laughing] He's mad that we had a good time.
- Yeah, he is.
- [Both laughing] How messed up and shady was that? I'm like, "where are we going? Where are we going?" The cab wouldn't tell us where we're going.
I was really sorry.
I had no idea.
And I'm pissed at Vinny and pauly, 'cause they didn't tell me.
- Don't be mad at me.
- [Dog growling] No, I'm pissed at you right now.
- Why? - I'm pissed at you and pauly.
- Why? - Because you knew it before I left, and you couldn't tell me.
To the point where me and deena were in the back seat, freaking out, like, "where the [Bleep] Are we going?" - I couldn't, though.
- And the cab wouldn't tell us.
I know, but it wasn't my prank.
I figured you and pauly would tell me.
- I'm not a snitch.
- *** To the point where I was about to call my dad and say, "pick me up in the city, 'cause I'm going home.
" It wasn't my idea, and and I had nothing to do with it.
But I would appreciate if you just told me.
Like, that's not funny.
I don't wanna be put in that position where I have to snitch on somebody.
I just stay out of it.
It's not my business.
It was his prank.
I didn't do anything.
If you wanna be mad at me, you can, but there's no reason to.
I just heard that you guys are mad at me.
But I didn't do anything.
- [Laughter] - Pauly So I'm mad at you for being mad at me for no reason! So try and talk to me! I'm mad! [Laughter] Pissed! [Laughter] I wanna know, when did you realize you weren't going to jenks? We saw buildings I thought you guys were gonna realize, though.
Really? Me and [Bleep] Deena? - [Laughing] Really? - I knew.
- So what are we doing, karma or - I think they wanted to just do karma.
How about we take two separate cabs, and you get your own cab? Cool, I'll go back to the city and I'll stay there.
[Bleep] Saturday night.
I'll come with you.
Yeah, I want some Ron, Ron juice.
- No.
- Can I have a glass? No.
Ron, really? - Come on.
- [Bleep].
And all the while you're still taking all your sweet time your heart was missing, and you don't know why it took so long to get here - Where we going tonight? - Karma.
- Karma.
- "Kar-ma.
" - What separates two words in a sentence? - Comma.
[Laughter] What does it cal a baby call a bottle? - Baba.
- Baba.
Where does pauly go for his haircut? - The "baba.
" - Hi, Sam.
- Aah! - What the hell? Oh, my God! - Am I dreaming or am I awake? - You look good.
Meatball! [Whirring] - Feel better? - Much better.
Sam wants to hang out with the girls, and Ron is just like a little puppy dog chasing after the girl.
I don't wanna, like Smother you.
You do look beautiful, though.
You're sucking up to me.
Ron, it's my first night back.
You could say you're beautiful all you want, but it doesn't change anything.
I wish my head wore a condom.
'Cause I'm getting mind [Bleep].
I'm going into your nasty-ass [Bleep] Bathroom, so All: Ohh! - That [Bleep] Stinks! - Help! We have an emergency with that toilet.
- It's disgusting.
- Oh, my God! Actually, I would have to say that's a [Bleep].
- I think I like Vinny a lot.
- Uh-oh.
If he brings home a girl, I'm gonna kill myself.
Vinny! Vinny brought a girl home.
I hate you! Synch by Benfo.
Me and Vinny are having a really good time right now.
Maybe he's starting to feel what I've been feeling.
Come to your bed.
You don't want to do this.
And then he wants nothing to do with me.
Like, make up your mind.
Can we call a cab really quick? - I'll call a cab for you.
- Aww, Mike.
It's a surprise; We're gonna take them to Times Square.
You're not going to jenk's, you're going to Times Square.
Is that New York City? - Yeah, you know - Where are we going?! It was a good prank.
We need to get him back somehow.
I'm leaving my home right now to go back into the madness at the Jersey Shore.
And I'm thinking to myself, "you're ready.
You can do this.
I know who you are, Sam.
You're gonna be fine.
" [Get crazy by lmfao] Dj pauly delvecchio! I'm going to the Jersey Shore, bitch! All right, we got a situation.
I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
[Laughing] After I have sex with a guy, I will rip their heads off.
Go Vinny! Go Vinny! You like the boobs? Do something crazy Snook, look what I got you, though, snook.
- Pickle? - Nope, better than that.
Some mother[Bleep] Ron Ron juice.
Yeah, I'm freaking out right now.
I am so anxious.
I don't know if these people are gonna want me back in the house.
I'm nervous to see Ron.
'Cause I don't know how what's gonna happen with that.
I just think I'm a ball of, like, different emotions right now.
You're making that with patron? You really are a patron.
- [Snickers] [lender whirring] So what does a baby suck on? [Bleep].
- [Laughs] - What does a baby call a bottle? What does it call a baby call a bottle? - Baba.
- Baba.
Where does pauly go for his haircut? - The "baba.
" - Hi, Sam.
Oh, my God! Hi, hon.
Yo, today is crazy! - Hi, Sam.
- What's up? When I hear pauly go, "oh, hey, Sam," I think pauly's joking around, like always.
I look up, and I'm like - How are you? Mwah! - Good.
How are you? Did you have a good li relief? - Yeah.
- Feel better? - Much better.
- You look good.
Am I dreaming or am I awake? I definitely think it'd be nice if Sam stayed out of the house a little bit longer.
Think I was just starting to find myself, and she walked through the door, and I'm just like FML.
I was expecting it, but I wasn't expecting it.
Have you talked to her on the phone today? And she said she was coming or no? No.
Where are they all? Let's go say hello.
Get down here, right now! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, you're back! - And you look so pretty.
- Oh, my God! I'm gonna cry, I'm so happy.
[Both laughing] I, like, was so hastatic that I almost cried.
- Get out of here! - [Squeals] - Hi.
- Sam, you look so pretty.
Hastatic is when you're, like, you know, when you're, like, super happy and, like Really happy.
All that fighting [Bleep] Is done, though, right? - Yeah.
- Tsh.
No.
- [Laughter] - You're an ass [Bleep].
Yo, honestly? She's a cool girl and everything, but There was no fighting.
Let's keep it that way.
- All right? - You surprised? - Well, not really.
- [Laughing] Guess what? Sammi's back.
[Inhales sharply] Ehh.
I didn't even know she was gone.
I didn't even know she was gone.
Whatever.
We'll go out and do what we normally do, you know.
I mean, we'll do it anyway, you know what I mean? So Ronnie's acting, uh, like he's not too happy either.
Didn't even really say hello to her too much.
You know, it's back to the old, uh, Ron and Sam saga.
Did you see Ron? Really, really quick.
- And - He didn't say anything.
Just said hello and walked away.
- I was like, "oh, my God.
" - So single Sammi or - Yes.
- Promise? - Yes.
- Are you happy? Yeah, I needed that, like, really, really bad.
Good.
Your mood's good.
Your nails are good.
My toes are good.
My nails are good.
I can go get nails done.
[Shouting] What? - [Indistict conversation] - [Laughs] Hi.
How we doin', good? Yeah.
You look pale.
- Me? - Right? Uh, I was just [Bleep] Like I saw a ghost, that's why.
[Laughing] It was shocking for you to walk through the door, nothing for nothing.
Pale.
I mean, now they're telling secrets.
- He was, like, so depressed about you.
- Oh, my God, so depressed.
Was it really that bad? Like, he's reallyThat bad? - Not a chance.
- We went to karma the other night, and we had like a long, like, drunk conversation, but he was like, "I know I was wrong.
" He was like, "I just lost the best thing I ever had.
" He goes, "I will never find a girl like that, ever again.
" So the fact that he knows, that he's a [Bleep] And he [Bleep] Up He needs to go through it.
I'm sorI hate to say it, but, like, I've been put through enough.
Like, mentally and emotionally I've been distraught.
We know.
- We'll see what happens.
- Right now, I need to focus on myself.
I feel bad for you now, dog.
[Laughs] I was a little thrown off by that for a second.
- I feel no different.
- Oh, God.
"Did he go out anywhere? Was he talking to a girl?" - "Wait, did he go to the gym?" - "Was he talking to a girl at the gym?" "No.
" "Dancing?" [Snickers] - "He went with pauly and Vinny?" - "Did they talk to girls?' "they went to get dinner.
" "Did he talk to girls there?" "Did he talk to the waitress?" [Laughs] - "Did he order food?" - "What did he order?" "Caesar salad.

Want me to go over there? For what? Snooki called, and I obey.
Huh? What? I wanna cuddle tonight.
If you really want me to I understand if you see a girl at the club and you want to bring her home, but If you really want me not to bring home a girl, tell me.
- I want - but you might you might - do your thing, you know, so - Nah.
Oh, I definitely want to try again with Vinny.
I actually named his penis Moby dick.
And I would love to try again to see if it would work.
Maybe tonight.
I wanna be with Vinny.
[Screaming] Get up! Yo, you just [Laughing] I'm annoyed.
All right, let's take the shot so we can get in the cab.

- To blowouts, boobs - To the trip to New York City! [All cheering] - Yo, cheers to Times Square! - Yeah! Times Square! Times Square! I don't wanna, like, smother you.
Things with me and Ronnie are awkward.
You're sucking up to me.
Ron pretty much looks like a douche bag.
We have an emergency with that toilet.
[All shouting] Help! [Upbeat music] - I missed you.
I really did.
- I miss you too.
I love you guys.
Single ladies! I can't hear you! - All: Single! - Single ladies! [All cheer] When Sam comes out in her new blue dress, I'm like, "God, you're [Bleep] Hot.

Like, [Bleep] Suffer for a little bit more.
Like, come on.
Suffer.
I don't wanna, like, - smother you, but - No.
Ron pretty much looks like a douche bag.
Sam wants to hang out with the girls, do her own thing.
And Ron's just like a little puppy dog chasing after the girl.
What's with you tonight? - Are you all right? - I'm happy you came back.
- Oh.
Are you leaving? - No.
- Why? Want me to? - Go on, have fun.
Never thought I'd regret you I'd better forget love you since I met you I think it's fair, if somebody wants their space, you gotta give it to them.

- But, hey, really think, like, I'm getting, like, feelings now.
Uh-oh.
I don't know what kind of message Vinny's sending Nicole, but Nicole and Vinny have some sexual tension that they need to really talk about.
'Cause it could be dangerous to the health.
If he brings home a girl, I'm gonna kill myself.
- What's your name? - Laura.
- Laura, I'm Vinny.
- Vinny? I'm Dominican.
- Dominican? All right, well, well, well.
Dominican girls are hot, because they can dance, they can move.
They got tans.
They got big butts.
You know, nice, full lips.
And Dominican girls got that flavor that an Italian guy needs.
I wanna have, like, ten of your babies.
- Ten? - Like right now.
Right now, ten of them? So tonight, we're gonna have ten babies.
I was I was serious, though.
I'm dead-ass serious.
As soon as I see a girl, I always look to the right or left of her to see if the girl has a cute friend for my boy pauly.
Yo, would you be the godfather of my baby too? Oh, hell, yeah.

" I was like, "all right, let's go home to Vinny.
" [Kiss] I don't take Laura to the smush room, because I got a bed.
Pauly knows how to not [Bleep] Block me in the room.
I know how to not [Bleep] Block pauly in the room.
It's kind of like we have our own individual smush rooms.
Where's Vinny? Vinny! Really? She's straight up crying over you Snooki's being a hypocrite for being mad at me for having a girl.
Meanwhile, snooki hooks up with all of seaside.
[Crying] I wanna be with you.
You didn't bring home a guy two nights ago? [Horn blaring] Deena, you're scaring me! - [Deena pounds on horn] - We're gonna die.
[Tires screeching] Ooh [Both giggling] You're fun.

- What are you doing to her? - Ron, I need to go pee.
- No, that's not okay.
- Ron, let me go piss.
Go piss upstairs.
Go.
Where are we going? He likes you.
Get it through your head.
Okay? - So I can't go to his room right now? No, because you know what that's gonna do? It's gonna 'cause big fight.
There's a girl in his bed.
- Vinny brought a girl home?! - Shh.
You don't need anybody to make you feel that way.
You're hot.
You can get whoever you want.
Sam's, like, going along, like a little [Bleep] Puppy.
It's like, you don't do that.
They're getting it in.
You see the light's off.
Leave 'em alone.
Vinny, brought a [Bleep] Girl home! [Muffled] - Snook, snook.
I love you.
- Really? Nicole, we're better off without any guys.
- I'm telling you.
- Sam, what? They always treat us so bad.
Why? Guys are [Bleep], and Ron is [Bleep].
So if I'm gonna say guys are [Bleep] And Ron's in the room, I'm gonna look right at him, 'cause he needs to know.
Ron's no different.
He does the same thing.
Big brother, little sister.
Were you not in the bed with [Bleep] Gianni the other night? - Come on.
- Vinny's an ass [Bleep], and that's it.
I don't even know why Ronnie would give me advice when he's, like, such, like a terrible boyfriend with Sam.
- Look, look look - get off me.
- Get off me.
- Will you listen to me, please? I'm going to bed.
And good night.
And good night.
So [Bleep] Over Vinny.
I'm looking out for the both of them.
Don't act like a drunk [Bleep] Though right now.
I love Ron.
But it's not our time right now.
Maybe in the future, you know, if he grows up.
Right now, I don't think he's really getting it, like where I'm coming from.
I can't be in a relationship with somebody like a cheater and a liar.
I can't do it.
Wait, I'm so [Bleep] Right now, because - Look at me.
- No, like I'm done Falling for the bull[Bleep].
I'm not gonna just fall back into your arms.
- I'm getting mind - [Bleep] Right now.
- Okay, then, I'm gonna go.
'Cause I don't want to do that to you.
I don't know what's going on in Sam's head.
Every time she says, "I'm done, I'm done, "we're done, I'm done,e, you're done, we're done, I'm done, you're done.
" Da da da da done done done done Like, I don't even know at this point.
Really.
Because it's not okay.
It's not okay.
[Whispering] This is ridiculous.
Jersey turnpike, that [Bleep].
Me and deena decided to walk home from the club.
I don't know what the hell we're doing.
I have to pee.
Can I pee? I'm gonna pee right over here.
I have a napkin in my purse! I have a napkin with a number.
It's a napkin, but it's a number on it.
I'll keep it always.
Eww! You peed on my foot! Eww! Eww! I got pee on my foot.
There's something wrong with me.
You peed on my foot.
I want you to wipe it off.
I'll wipe it off in the house.
How you doin'? Um, could I also have another cab, please? - Wanna cuddle me tonight? - I will.
Wow.
I can't hold my pee anymore.
- Who is these girls? - Come in here.
Come on.
Maybe Vinny's not the one for you.
But somebody out there is.
I'll cuddle with you.
[Crying] He brought somebody home.
Come on, she looked like a [Bleep] Rodent.
[Crying] - Hit me up.
- All right, I will.
It was it was nice to meet you.
- Bye, Vinny.
- Bye-bye.
Come on, you know he's doing it on purpose just to get a rise out of you.
Really? He's such a pig, just like Ron is.
- He's such a pig.
- I'm so over it.
Yo, she's like crying right now over you.
- Just so you know.
- That's so stupid.
She wasn't crying the other night with gianni.
- That's what I said to her.
- But that's her drunk.
She gets with gir guys every time she can.
She wants to have sex with me, meanwhile, she gets with a kid the night before.
Get the hell out of here.
Can you go in there and talk to her? Jenni, come on.
I'm what did I do wrong? I don't know, but she's straight up crying over you right now.
Snooki's being a hypocrite for being mad at me for having a girl, meanwhile, snooki hooks up with all of seaside.
[Claps hands and sniffs] I didn't do anything wrong.
Nicole, why are you crying? Like, why are you crying? Tell me.
I wanna be with you.
You don't understand.
Nicole, you didn't bring home a guy two nights ago? Vinny, stop.
You didn't bring home a guy two nights ago? I didn't do anything.
Just go have [Bleep] Fun.
Nicole, you're drunk.
Tomorrow, we're gonna talk about this and it's gonna be all good.
I don't care if you're mad at me.
I just want you to be okay.
I love you.
I don't know, I guess I'm wrong.
Because I can handle her getting with guys, and she's upset that I had a girl home tonight.
So if I'm a piece of [Bleep], I'm a piece of [Bleep].
[Snooki sobbing] - She is starting to grow some feelings for you.
Do the right thing, vincenzo.
- And then he's bringing home all these girls.
- Are you fully gay? - No.
Awesome! [Bleep] My life.
- Nasty, bro.
- What'd you do to our bathroom? - Me? - That's disgusting.
Nobody in this house owns up to anything.
- Clean that bathroom.
- I'm not touching it.
- Vinny - [Bleep] Stinks.
[Water bubbling] - You guys wanna do bowling? - Yeah.
Nicoley, get your butt up.
We're going bowling.
Get your little guidette butt up.
I'm a little depressed right now, just because everyone's going bowling.
They're going out to eat.
And I just can't get out of bed 'cause I'm so tired.
I'm so hung over.
And I'm still mad at Vinny.
[Sighs] [Bleep].
- Yo! - Let's go! - We're leaving! - Mike! Let's go! - Who's driving? - I'm driving.
I'm actually a good driver.
Snooki's not coming, right? I'll follow them.
Does everybody have their seatbelts on? I miss driving.
Wow, deena just made the most awful turn - I've ever seen in my life.
- Deena's driving? - What the hell? - That was bad? This girl's out of control.
I just spilled my coffee, and I don't even drink coffee.
She turned and almost went into the cars on this side.
Deena, move to the left.
- We're gonna die.
- I'm fine.
[Laughing] My God.
Literally, we're on the parkway on the way to bowling, and our car was going off the Lane, like, into the side railing.
[Car horn blares] Deena, you're scaring me.
We're gonna die.
Deena might be the worst driver in the tristate area.
I mean, I was scared for my life.
[Tires screech] - What was that? - Come on! - What was it? - We're gonna die.
It was the worst decision for her to drive.
- We're gonna die.
- Wait check in here.
- I might have a napkin.
- We're gonna die.
I kept saying, "we're gonna die, we're gonna die, we're gonna die.
" [Indistinct chatter] Ah, you're gettin' drunk.
- You got blue balls? - Yeah.
You are not driving home, little blast.
[Laughing] Ohh! I wanna kiss the ground out there right now.
Really? It was that bad? Damn! Bowl for her.
What's going on? - What? - With my girl.
- It's more complicated than that.
- Like, do you like her or no? I love Nicole.
She's starting to grow some feelings for you.
Stay! Break! Stee-rike! No, she's like crying hysterically all day and night over you.
I know, I don't want her to cry, but I think you guys should have your own talk.
None of my business.
She just creeps up on me.
Like all of a sudden, everything's fine.
She's hookin' up with guys, you do you.
And then all of a sudden, she starts crying.
Do the right thing, vincenzo.
I don't feel like bowling anymore; I'm done.
Have your shoes and everything? I can't make lefts in [Bleep] Jersey, right? You all right? You better? I feel embarrassed.
I remember leaving the club.
The whole time, you were talking about how much you like Vinny and love Vinny.
I just remember hearing you crying the whole night.
Do you have feelings for him, or you were drunk? I mean, I like him.
Like, you like like him? I think so.
That's not good.
'Cause then why would I say that? - [Sighs] I - I think I like him.
Like, he's a comfort zone.
He's always the one that you can fall back on.
And he's your roommate.
I thought you were just drunk and being stupid.
I was like, "she's gonna wake up tomorrow and not even know what the [Bleep] She did.
" I'm embarrassed.
[Bleep] My life.
It's just not a good look for me to, like, starting to have, like, feelings for him, like, liking him.
And then he's bringing home all these girls, telling me he's not gonna bring anyone home, so we can cuddle, and then he brings somebody home.
It just makes me look stupid.
- Is she embarrassed? - I think I think she's embarrassed.
I think, just, everything that's been going on, the whole Nick thing.
It's like one thing after another.
I think she just looks for relationships.
That's what it is.
And I think every guy she does start to talk to, she thinks of it as, "this could be my boyfriend.
" She's not the type of girl that can just hook up with somebody.
- That sucks.
- It does suck.
- I feel bad.
- I know.
Leave me alone You okay? Can I stay here for a second? - No! Mm-mmm.
- No? I just want to be alone.
- Go away.
- Go away? I'm trying to get away now and then I lost my mind I lost my mind but it always finds me again I'm trying to get away Oh, my God! That fat one is actually kind of cute.
Like, I would definitely, like, hang out with that.
Nice muscles.
S.
T.
D.
From what? You can't get an s.
T.
D.
From that.
- Would you like to call that doctor in there? - It won't be long before Mike's [Bleep] Falls off.
- Ohh! - Ohh! This is like the perfect Sunday.
Yo, that bathroom's gross again.
I just cleaned it two days ago.
I was gonna touch it, and I'm not.
I cleaned that I can't clean it again for the - I'm not doing it - I'll let bugs go in there.
What'd you do to our bathroom? - Me? - It's disgusting.
Me? Nobody in this house owns up to anything.
There's a clogged toilet.
Nobody knows who did it.
There's like a [Bleep] Ghost in this house or something.
I'm going into your nasty-ass [Bleep] Bathroom, so Wait till he opens that toilet.
He's gonna turn right around.
- [Laughing] - No, he It is it is beyond stinky in there.
It's so gross.
[Coughing] Let me in, [Bleep].
All: Ohh! [Laughing] What is that? - Oh, did somebody just [Bleep] In there? - Oh, my God! I think somebody still [Bleep] In it! Oh, my God! I'm choking on the smell.
I can taste it in my mouth right now.
Let me see.
Ohh! Ohh! Oh, there goes that water's green, bro! Water's green! I know, it's like algae.
- Ohh! - Ohh! Ah, that [Bleep] Stinks.
[Laughs] Aah! The smell is just "permanating" through the air.
It is just It's just not a good situation.
I can't even elaborate.
Who took another [Bleep] In there? 'Cause that, it was like - nobody could do that.
- Somebody did it.
Somebody took an extra [Bleep] In it.
Why do they do that? If there's a plumber in this universe that will face the [Bleep] In my toilet, he deserves a medal.
Help! [Phone line ringing] - Hello, Shore store.
Danny speaking.
- Danny, it's jenni.
- Hey, what's up, jenni? - How we doing? - We have an emergency with that toilet.
I thought you guys took care of that a long time ago.
No, it never got fixed, so we need your help.
All right.
That makes total sense to me.
I know, we're ass[Bleep].
I get it.
I'm sorry, I can't do nothin' for you.
It's Sunday night.
I'm kind of busy.
Just like every other plumber.
You guys should have taken care of this days ago.
Tomorrow, I can have that taken care of, but tonight, you guys'll just have to deal with it.
- Okay.
- All right? - All right, bye.
- Later, bye.
This sucks.
[Bleep] Sucks.
Maybe if some of our bathrooms were fixed, some of us could use them all at the same time.
Plumber's coming at 11:30.
[Spraying] [Doorbell rings] Oh, my God, smells like [Bleep].
[Ding dong] Hello.
How are you? I'm rich and that's Mike.
We're the plumbers.
- Oh, hello.
How are you? - Good.
How are you? - What's, uh, what's the problem? - You might be scared.
- Ah, great.
- The plumbers are here, finally.
The fat one is actually kind of cute, like, I would definitely, like, hang out with that.
- Nice! - Can you fix that? UhI'm gonna definitely try.
- Are you scared? - No, I'm not scared.
No.
Does your butt crack hang out? - Yes, it does, actually.
- Cool.
- I have to get out of here.
- Yeah.
Good luck.
Ugh.
Yeah, grab the toilet auger off the back of the truck.
I'll try that first, and then after that, we're gonna have to take the toilet out, pretty much.
- How long has it been like this? - Like two weeks.
Ah, God.
That's lovely.
I'm surprised you guys don't have maggots in here yet.
- It smells so bad.
Maggots? - Yeah, maggots, absolutely.
They'll crawl into the bedrooms.
Get out! Let me in.
- Oh, my God, I'm gonna vomit.
- Excuse me.
- Nice muscles.
- [Chuckles] Thanks.
[Cranking] Ugh! I don't think I'm gonna eat for four days.
[Laughs] It's stuck.
Somebody flushed a pair of underwear Oh, my God! Actually, I would have to say that's a [Bleep].
That's probably Vinny's.
Give it to one of your housemates.
Yeah, you can't flush [Bleep] Tees down the toilet.
- No.
- Who does that? Eww! [Toilet flushes] Works now.
- Do you scrub it clean too? - No, you're scrubbing it clean.
- Seriously? - Seriously.
I'll spray it down as much as I can if you have some, like, cleaner in the house somewhere.
Cascade? Hi, boo! Oh, my God.
So guess why the toilet is clogged.
- Why? - Someone flushed a [Bleep] Tee.
- What? - Swear to God.
- Who wears [Bleep] Tees? Vinny? - I wanna [Bleep] Them up.
Watch the splash.
I guarantee it's like when they took a shower, they [Bleep] Dropped it in the toilet and tried to flush it You know what I mean? - 'Cause they didn't want to pick it out.
- Yeah, they didn't want to pick it out.
Flush it a few times, make sure there's, like Not the rest of an outfit down there.
Did we get a size on that [Bleep] Tee, or a brand? - Oh, yeah, what size? - It was a small.
Small? - It's Vinny's! - Vinny! You can use it.
It's cleaned up a little bit.
- Thanks.
- You guys have a nice rest of your day.
And I'll send the boys the bill.
- Yeah, send the boys the bill.
- Absolutely.
Have a good day, girls.
- Thank you so much.
- Bye.
All my [Bleep] Is gonna smell now.
Roger, I've been dying to tell you this.
Someone flushed a [Bleep] Tee down the toilet.
I can't wait whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on.
Oh, it's the big time, yeah.
Who's shirt was in the bathroom, that gray one, by any chance? I don't shower down there.
- I don't know.
- [Giggling] What's up? [Laughing] Find out who put the [Bleep] Tee in Both: The toilet? Vinnie! [Laughter] What are you looking at, bro? Why would I put a [Bleep] Tee down my own toilet? This is my theory.
A guy might have been getting in the shower or change.
Took the [Bleep] Tee off.
It dropped in the toilet.
Some people don't wanna pick it out of the toilet.
So they're like, "all right, I'm gonna flush it.
" That is an amazing rationalization.
Maybe there was another alien planet out in front, and he shot a laser beam through the glass and you got scared, used the wife beater to cover your eyes, it slipped, you forgot the [Bleep] Tee was over there.
You didn't want the evidence of the alien, so you put it down the toilet and you flushed it and you - I got it! - You know what? That happened, now that you said it.
That's what happened.
I am asking someone with the good graces to go [Bleep] Clean that bathroom.
- I'm not touching it.
- I cleaned it five times already.
And while you're at it, hit the community bathroom.
Yeah.
Word.
- Busted.
- Me? - I don't know.
- Someone.
To be honest with you, I feel bad, because I haven't washed a dish yet, I haven't cleaned [Bleep] Yet, except my room, so I think this is the time for me to step up.
So I decide to do it.
Ooh, I can feel it let me show you the way Poop.
Aah! The smell of cool wind Man.
Just lovin' the place I'm in.
Ohh.
Poop stains! Take just a minute to dig right in it dig right into all the love you bring just lie back and watch it all go right - [Gurgling] - Aah! [Laughing] No.
- [Toilet running] - [Laughing] Here, in between his sheets.
Mike, we got you, mother[Bleep].
Ugh, I had that chick over the other night.
- Bad [Bleep]? - It smelled like grated cheese.
The cheese bed is the best prank.
You're a sucker.
For me? - Really? - I made mad [Bleep] Today.
- This is the ones I wanted.
- I know.
Ronnie, definitely I feel like is reformed.
I, like, love talking to him.
I love being with him now.
Just because he's happy and he's different.
He's changed.
Get your butt up, please.
- Snook, you staying home? - I don't know.
- Let's do something else.
- Like what? Think we're all just gonna be sober And hang out tonight for the, like, the first time all summer.
Let's get virgin margaritas.
I actually like not going to the bar.
Right? So me, Ron, and Sam, team sober tonight.
We wanna do something fun.
So we decided to go to beach bar.
- Cricket.
- [Laughing] There's nobody here! - Oh, no.
Oh, no.
- Cool! I want to wake up and not have a hangover.
And, you know what, I can have a good time without drinking.
So, you know, [Bleep] You, alcohol.
Hi.
Something to drink while you're looking? Can we have three tequilas? [Laughing] I'm just kidding.
- No, no, no, no.
- I will Yay, should have seen your eyeballs.
Oh, my God, this is gonna be a horrible time.
The weather in seaside tonight is pretty dreary.
But we're all going to aztec together.
Hopefully, there's a couple hot chicks and good music pumping, and we're gonna have a good time tonight.
[Upbeat music] I'm gay.
She's my girlfriend.
For real? Are you fully gay? - No.
- Awesome.
[All laugh] Oh, there he is.
You look good.
I haven't seen Roger for a while.
Um, I was just Real excited to see him.
He's so cute.
Cheers.
Cheers.
So what else? - Nothing.
- What'd I miss? I went spray tanning naked today.
So am I going to get all orange later? - I took a shower.
- Oh.
I was worried about that.
Rubbing off on you.
- How old are you? - 21.
Are you sure you're 21? Wanna see my I.
D.
? That was when my hair was blonde.
All right.
21, you're good.
You're good.
All right, so what are we gonna get Mike back with? Fart on his pillow! So, like you could fart on his pillow, so he gets pink eye.
Because Mike loves pranks so much sending me to the city, last year putting [Bleep] Under Vinny's bed.
Why don't you get a taste of your own medicine, Michael? Let's open up the fridge and see what we've got.
Let's see what we're working with here.
- Cream cheese.
- Grated cheese.
[Laughing] That'll do.
So me, snook, and Sam are gonna go upstairs and prank his bed.
[All giggling] Ooh.
Looks like a pizza.
Should I add some cream cheese? [All giggling] Ear it into his sheet.
[Laughing] He doesn't wash his sheets anyway.
So he's never gonna find it.
And we just started making a nice smorgasbord of all kinds of cheese and red pepper.
That's for sending me to New York, mother[Bleep].
- [Laughter] - [Raspberry] [Laughter] [Raspberry] And that's like the sealing to the whole joke.
[Burps] You got cheesed, you old cheesy bastard.
[Laughing] Yeah, it's gonna stink.
- Mike, we got you, mother [Bleep].
- Oh, we got you.
This is for sending me to New York, you [Bleep] - Your face.
- Cream ch - [both scream] - [Laughter] - Team sober, bitch! - Ohh! - Booyah! [Cheering] [Upbeat music] I think you're hot, but you wanna do you? I'm happy where I am.
Promise? Promise.
- Promise? - Promise.
I promise.
My girl is 100% d.
T.
F.
When do you go home? And that's it.
So add me to the smush board.
I got a hot chick.
Bringing her to the bedroom.
And I'm getting it in.
Hello? Pauly? Boo boo! We all know Roger.
Wanna see my duck phone? Right there.
- Hi, Dee.
- This is Sammi.
This is Ronnie, this is snooki.
- Hi.
-This is Blair, this is Blair, this is Blair.

- What up? - Hello.
- That's snooki.
- Hi! - Hi.

UmProbably gonna have ice tea.

I used to love that game.
Me too.
- You want water? - Yeah.
My nipples won't stay in my shirt.
[Laughs] [Liquid pouring] Their beer goggles are terrible.
- [Laughing] - Scares me.
You want some comfortable stuff? All right, good idea.
Put these on.
Oh, no.
The cheese.
They're both going to get pink eye.
Good.
That's gross.
Smells like garbage.
Oh, my God.
Speaking of smell, ugh.
I had that chick over the other night.
- Ugh.
- Ew! - I had to kick her out.
- What smell was it? It was obviously her, you know what I'm saying? It wasn't me, it [Bleep] Smelled like [Bleep] Grated cheese.
- Ohh.
- And but - like a Sushi market? - No, but no, it didn't.
It just smelled like grated cheese.
And I was like, "what is that smell?" She's like, "do you want your clothes back?" I'm like, "no, you can keep the clothes.
" - Grated cheese? - Yeah.
- I think the cheese bed is the best prank in Jersey Shore history, just because no one ever pranked Mike like that, and the fact that he thinks it's a grenade.
Grenades [Bleep] Smelling like cheese, when, really, it's your frickin' bed smelling like cheese.
You're a sucker.
You're a sucker, bro.
- What? - He got a girl over.
And he goes, "I couldn't hook up with her, 'cause she smelled like grated cheese.
" It is so extremely satisfying, knowing that we got, like, the ultimate pranker himself.
[Laughter] That's gross.
This prank is friggin' fabulous.
She left, I had to spray my bed with axe.
And they smelled horrible.
I didn't know what it was.
I'm like, "yo, it smells like grated cheese right now.
" So then she gave me [Bleep], and she was done, and I'm like, "yo, I got your taxi ready outside.
" What? You can get an s.
T.
D.
From that, you know.
S.
T.
D.
From what? You can't get an s.
T.
D.
From that.
Yes, you can! That's a big way to get one! You can get it you can get something from [Bleep]? I don't think you're correct.
Would you like to call that doctor in there? Mike is so dumb when it comes to safe sex and s.
T.
D.
S.
I'm [Bleep] Calling the doctor.
- [Bleep].
- We have a doctor in the book.
Like, are you kidding me? This goes back to fifth grade, like sex education.
You have to practice safe sex.
What happens when something smells like grated cheese? No, we're gonna also find out if you catch - hello? - Hi, how are you? - How are you? - Grated cheese.
My roommates would like to know if you can still catch a sexually transmitted disease without using a condom if one of my guys in the house gotOralPleasure.
Certain ones, yes.
Usually the main one that's contagious that way is herpes.
The main one that's contagious that way is herpes.
Uck! And we also had a woman come in here - that had a smell like - Grated cheese.
Grated cheese, does that mean she had a, um - Yeast infection.
- Yeast infection? - Yeah, possibly, yeah.
- Yes, possibly.
All: Ohh! It won't be long before Mike's [Bleep] Falls off.
Wow, she really left her mark.
Oh, yeah.
I just got [Bleep].
That's it.
I did make out with her Which means you probably might get some yeast in you.
[All groan] Hi, dear.
- Are you going out? - Yeah.
I want to apologize if I said, like, [Bleep] Up [Bleep] To you the other night.
I was really drunk.
Mm -hmm.
And if I was, like, mad stupid.
It was upsetting me.
I didn't want you to cry.
Yeah, but you know I can't listen.
I just don't want anything to, like, change between our friendship.
'Cause you know I love you.
- I don't want you to cry like that anymore.
- My bad.
- Not because of me, but because of anything, you know? You were, like, hysterical.
[Laughs] Like [Whimpering] - [Laughing] Stop! - Like one of those cries.
Like Yeah, embarrassing.
Cool So I can keep on smashing girls? Yeah.
*** Awesome.

Super excited.
They need to know that I'm coming for them.
My hairdryer.
The one thing I am bringing, 'cause I got a big blowout, is the international plug.
Just hope the rest of them bring it, 'cause they're not using mine.
When I get to Italy, it's gonna be like an international panty raid.
I'm going crazy.
I need to get some passport photos, please.
Ready? I have a passport, regular license, international license.
I'm ready to hit Italy.
Passports are here! Oh, yeah! I figure an Italian guy in a Vespa is like a hot guy here on a street bike.
All: Yeah.
- I am so excited to go to Italy! I'm gonna do everything wait, ciao is for "hello" and "good-bye.
" - Yeah.
- What about "thank you?" - Gracias.
- That's Spanish.
- In Italy, I'm expecting to bring a guy home, but I won't do sex.
Do you like the boobs? - Very nice.
[Camera clicks] - You know, maybe just, like, figure them out and then maybe do sex later.
Italy, bitches! - Bella.
Tu Bella.
[Speaking italian] There are a lot of things that I wanna accomplish in Italy.
[Speaking Italian] I want to learn Italian.
I want to master the language.
D.
T.
F.
Come with me [Speaks italian] I have a big I wanna find a nice, real, Italian, traditional girl.
Vinny's always been [Bleep] Mature, all right? [Clears throat] But this time, I'm mature with a beard.
I don't know if any of the housemates are gonna recognize me with this beard.
I'm so much more better-looking.
[Phone ringing] Hello? - Vinny, are you all packed up, my dude? - Yeah, I'm packed up pretty much.
Why? What's up? - Well, yo, check this out.
Since we're all going to Italy together, I was gonna come by staten island, scoop you up, and then we'll go to the airport together.
- No, how about this? Come to my family's house.
We'll get Uncle nino over there, we'll get the boys, and we'll send us off the right way.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- All right, bro, see you soon.
- Mom! I'm very excited to go to Italy.
Do you think they sell eyelashes in Italy? It's kind of like another world.
It's, like, I don't know what goes on there.
[Screams] I started to see this guy.
We've been together for six months.
- God.
- I need panties.
Unless you want me to go commando.
- No, they'll fit.
- Obviously, gianni's, like, a little bit nervous about me going to Italy because it's kind of like a long-distance relationship.
- Do you have anymore suitcases? - No.
- All right.
- I think he's, you know, a little scared with Vinny.
But you know, I reassured him that's definitely not gonna happen.
I'm not gonna be an idiot and [Bleep] This up.
You gonna be good? - I'll be good.
- I'll be good.
- All right.
Better be.
- I have no idea where Italy is on the map.
But I do know what shape it is, and it's like a boot.
- How you doing, buddy? - Good.
- Uh, I actually, I need a passport.
- Absolutely, just step right over here.
- Lock up your daughters, handcuff your wives, the situation's taking over the Italian nation.
Oh, wow, that's hot.
The difference between an Italian girl and a Jersey girl is European girls are more free-spirited.
And I'm excited to find out.
Snooks called me yesterday.
She was like, "oh, my God, I lost so much weight.
You know, you're gonna love me," or whatever.
And I didn't know.
I mean If she lost some pounds I'll hit it.
- [Chuckles] Look at that smile.
- Yes.
- This way? - A little bit more.
- Jwoww and her boobies are going to Italy.
Italy has no idea.
I will be shocked as all hell if I see a gorilla in Italy.
- You look amazing.
- After the shore house, I kept my relationship going with Roger.
- If a guy comes up, you're out, whatever, grabs your ass Italian guys are known to be, like, kinda touchy-feely.
Boom.
- And then just walk away.
- Out, done.
That's it.
- I wouldn't cheat on Roger in Italy, but I don't even think they make with tattoos out there so nobody really has anything to worry about.
I just wanna make sure that I stay like this in Italy.
Me too.
- What up, Italy? Single Ronnie's back.
Single Ronnie, worrying about himself, going to Italy with three of his boys.
Passport picture? Gun show.
Good lookin' guy right there.
Fresh start in Italy.
No more being a bitch.
- If you go out with Sam, I'm gonna kick you in your [Bleep] Nuts when you get back, I swear to God.
- In Italy, there'll be no more me and Sam drama.
'Cause I just wanna have a good time.
- No crying.
No, none of that.
- I have cramps [Speaking Italian] - [Laughing] - My motto for Italy is to not sit at home and cry, lie in my bed, be miserable, sulk in my own sorrows Food and drink.
Both: Where's the alcohol? - Me and Ron broke up after seaside.
I had time to heal.
And I'm okay with things.
Me and Ron, enough time has passed.
But I, like, will always love him.
And we're just friends.
I feel, like, so much better about myself.
I'm not gonna let the whole, like, Ron thing really get to me.
In that house, there's always issues.
- But you just have to come out on top.
- You don't have to be on top, okay? Oh, my God! - Please don't- just please don't- - # so be my Jersey girl # - oh, my God.
- Uh, I totally just broke my nail.
- # the girl inside # - me and the girls came up with a game plan.
We're gonna get together at deena's and slumber party, and fun, and fly out together.
And obviously, it's gonna be a race between the girls and the guys to get to the house and pick rooms.
- We should've rented a van, that's what we should've did.
- Dad, no! You're squishing them.
Whoo-hoo! [Horn honking] - # you're a Jersey girl # - Italy, here I come! Whoo! - First thing you're gonna do.
What's the first thing you're gonna do when you get there? - I'm gonna find out the age of consent.
All: [Chuckles] Lift their arms, and if they got hair you're good to go.
- So my boys are gonna be here any second, and I'm very excited that they're gonna enjoy my family feast before we all go to Italy.
We don't want any.
All: Oh! - My family, they are Italians, the right way.
Dj pauly d's here! - There's nothing more authentic than my family.
[Chatter overlaps] - Look at this boy, like a big [Bleep] Spartan! The food had to have been the table.
If you wanna say d.
T.
[Bleep], you say, [Speaking Italian] All: [Laughing] - So our game plan for this dinner is we're gonna eat a lot, and then learn some Italian, and then plan out what we're gonna do once we hit Italy.
[Speaking italian] All: [Laughing] Yay! Hi! - Hi.
- I was so excited for everybody to get here, I'm ready to pop open some champagne.
Hey, you.
- How many bags do you have? Just one? - Three.
- All right.
- Hi! - Hey.
This bitch has eight freakin' bags, if not more.
Holy [Bleep].
- I know.
- Really? - Who the hell is carrying your bags through the airport? - I don't know what guys do on sleepovers, though.
- They probably had strippers over.
- Now I feel bad, I should've ordered some male strippers.
- Hey, dad.
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Ew! All: [Laughing] - No offense.
- [Chuckles] - All right, focus, gentlemen! - What? - From the airport.
Okay, I need a game plan.
I need a way to get to the house.
How are we getting there? - It depends.
- Bus or a train.
- Whatever we do, we have to get there before the girls.
I don't want them to get the good room.
- Dude, we can get there a day late and still get there before the girls.
I don't know what the house looks like, I don't know where it is, but I need to be in a nice room.
And I would love to just roommate with my boy pauly again.
- What time you have to get up tomorrow morning? Oh, early flight.
[Club music] - everybody hit the floor and get ready to roll - you ready? Where's my stuff? - # ready, ready, ready # [Horn honking alarm] - I'm feeling great.
Wake up this morning, I'm ready to hit it.
I'm ready to hit the airport.
- Men, we're ready? - Let's go.
Bye, love you.
Make sure you call me! All: We're going to Italy! Whoo! - Whoo-hoo! - Yes! - We're going to italia, italia.
- Can't wait to go to Italy! - Yeah, buddy.
- Bye, bye, vin.
Whoo! - Italy, get ready, because here we come.
Blast in a glass, bitches.
- Good-bye, United States of America.
[Speaking Italian] [Chuckles] - How do you say "go fast?" Fast, fast? - Rapido.
- Ciao.
- Haul ass.
- Where do we go? I'm just running.
- Fumble! Are you kidding me? - This is how the guidos get to italia.
First we stop off at Madrid to pick up a few hotties.
- [Chuckles] - Can we walk in Madrid first? - Madrid, first.
Do a layover in Madrid, first.
- The girls have a layover too? We have a connecting flight in Madrid.
We don't know if the girls have a connecting flight.
We're trying to get there before the girls.
We do not want them to get there first, so we're trying to rush.
- Really? We're traveling to Italy, and then we land Oh! We realize we're in Germany- like "dosseldorf.
" - We're in "dosseldorf.
" - What is it? Dusseldorf? - Dolcedorf.
- Dusseldorf.
- Dusseldorf.
- We have, like a two-hour layover.
So the Dusseldorf.
You know, that's funny.
- Next stop, Italy.
Finally.
[Wavve's take on the world] - # to take on the world # would be something, to take on the world - that looks like Florence up ahead.
This is the first time I've ever seen the motherland.
- We are here.
[Speaking Italian] - to take on the world would be something something - instead of landing in Florence, we landed in Milan.
So that's not where we need to be.
- I can't see, though.
- Just follow my weave.
- Ugh, I'm having an anxiety attack.
Whoa, driving blind.
Coming through.
Oh, God, I'm gonna run over somebody.
It's hard for all of us.
I mean, we can't luggage all that [Bleep].
I mean, it's, like, 100 pounds each, and we're all, like, Ooh, I gotta convert my money somehow.
Is that where I get pesos? - Yeah, I would think so.
[Cracking noise] - Something just exploded.
- Is that poop? - My bronzer exploded! It just leaked.
- All of it? - Through the whole thing.
I am down a can of bronzer.
I only have about eight cans left.
And in my world, that'll last about ten days.
What's the easiest way to get to Florence? - Direct? - Is that for the train? - Train no, bus.
- We have to get on the bus.
- Ugh! - The bus is leaving.
- Can we run? - Let's go, girls.
Haul ass.
Well, how far is this thing? - Run.
- Come on, girls.
- I'm gonna [Bleep] In my pants.
- Oh, my God, they're running.
Where do we go? I'm just running.
[Loud thud] - Oh! - Fumble! Are you kidding me? I haven't been in Italy for two seconds and I already fell.
All: [Giggles] I think I broke my hand.
Who would've thought? Me falling on my face? Let's be real.
- Dude, my heart's in my throat right now.
This is what gives me blemishes.
Oh, [Bleep].
Are you kidding me? - Where are you? - Jenni? - Around it.
- Oh.
- You have a wedgie.
- I know.
- I wonder if the boys are gonna have this much problems.
Whoo-hoo! Now I'm in Italy, and it's "situazione.
" When we land in Florence, I'm breathing Italian air for the first time, I have Italian sun on me.
I touch the ground just to feel the Italian ground for the first time.
So it's definitely cool, the way we arrived into Italy.
- What? - Gonna get a cab.
- Cab's here.
- Load 'em up, boys.
- I think we're gonna get to the house first.
We might get there without Mike and his nine bags of luggage 'cause we gotta take seven cabs.
- We need another one.
- But we're definitely gonna get to the house before the girls.
- Yo, how we doing this? - Move over.
Pauly move.
- Ooh.
- Oh, yeah.
Pack it in like a clown car.
- How do you say "go fast?" Fast, fast.
- Rapido.
- Say "ciao, ciao.
" The traffic.
[Horn honking] - Oh.
- This is not real life.
- The traffic.
[Horn honking] - I pictured we'd be there by now.
- This can't be normal traffic.
- So wait, our 45-minute trip now just turned into another three hours? - I feel like I'm gonna cry.
- Nicole.
- I'm not kidding.
- Are you all right? I'm not really gonna cry, I just feel like crying.
[Giggles] [Horn honking] - Firenze.
- Belle, belle.
This is Italy right there.
It is beautiful.
It's the most "beautifullest" country I've ever seen.
- Feel like I'm on Bradley Avenue.
- Driving through Florence for the first time, I'm just taking it all in.
Major culture shock right now.
Look at all these bikes.
Are these rented ones? They're, like, touching each other.
Yeah, those are all real.
- Ciao, Bella.
- Speak English to them.
- No, they like it when I speak Italian.
They like my Italian-English accent.
- I hope they don't put points on my license, 'cause I'm [Bleep] Italian- - no, we are not gonna be able to drive here.
- The streets are so small and the alleys are so narrow, Ronnie's not gonna be able to fit through the alley.
He's gonna have to turn himself sideways.
- Oy.
There it is.
- Is this our house right here? - Look at that.
- When we pull up to this house, it's humongous.
I don't even know what it is.
They got these big doors that could fit, like, I don't know, king Kong in them, they're so huge.
[Laughing] There's another flight.
All: [Cheers] - Watch out- - it's my cardio! - Where's the elevator? - Oh, yeah! - Oh, yeah! - Oh, my God.
- We went up two giant flights of stairs, until we finally got to the foyer of the castle.
- Oh, this is huge.
- There's beautiful views.
We have a nice, little patio, we have a grill - Big time, yeah.
- Jacuzzi.
We have a jacuzzi inside the house.
Let's grab rooms right now.
- I am grabbing rooms right now.
Wow, this is dope.
Oh, this is what's up.
Look at this.
- This is the room right here.
This is the [Bleep] Room.
- Yo, let's take it.
Let's claim it.
- Claim it right now.
- Scoping out all the rooms, I want a room with my boy Vinny for sure.
And the dopest room we found has three beds.
Me and Vinny got it on lock.
- I got this one.
- Ronnie! I'm with you.
- All right.
It's one room with two beds, and sitch grabs that immediately with Ronnie.
And we'll leave the rest of the rooms for the girls.
- Yo, what [Bleep] Girl is gonna be our third roommate, bro? Probably deena.
- Yeah, you know it's gonna be her.
- It could be deena.
- It's cool.
- The roommate situation was just, like I figure if me and Sam were together, we're probably gonna smush.
So let me not get myself into that kind of situation.
- Yo, we got the [Bleep] Thing that cleans your ass and [Bleep].
We have a bidet.
So a bidet is very European.
It's a way of cleaning your butt hole after you go to the bathroom.
We're good.
It feels kinda good, too, you know? On a lonely night You know? - I can't believe we got here first.
- The girls are gonna be pissed.
- Uh.
- Look at how pretty.
- This is gorgeous.
- Oh, my God.
This is-this is it.
Is this it? I wonder if the boys are here.
Hello? - Oh, no.
- Oh, this isn't gonna work.
No.
- Hey, Ron.
- You cut your hair? - It's so difficult seeing your ex-boyfriend.
But he looks really good.
Oh, yeah! - Oh, my God.
This is-this is it.
- Wow! It's like a castle! - Oh, my God, this is so beautiful.
- Wow! Are the boys here? - What the [Bleep]? - Who is it? All: [Screams greetings] - What's up, girls? - Oh, my God.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, she smells like- smells like spray tan in here already.
- Oh! - How are you? Where's the rooms? Go.
- We walk into the house, and it is beautiful.
I'm in love.
Like, decorated Italy-style.
Everything's just gorgeous.
- I love this [Bleep] House.
- But I was pissed off because the boys were already there.
- Is there another room? - Hi.
- Did you cut your hair? - Yeah.
Cute.
- Ronnie looks good.
[Chuckles] Hey, Ronnie.
- I mean, it's so difficult seeing your ex-boyfriend, but he looks really good.
- Oh, yeah! I'm the tannest one here! Yeah! - You guys wanna see the outside? - Yeah.
- I don't know single Sammi, so I'm really curious to see what's gonna happen with Sammi.
I don't know if she's gonna go out there and try to get dudes.
And the onlyly thing I see changed, now she's got bigger boobs.
- Can you guys help us? - Yeah, we'll help you.
- Be careful, be careful, be careful.
- [Bleep] - It's great seeing the girls and everything, but [Bleep], the girls come with 50 more bags that we have to pile up these stairs.
- [Grunts] It sounds like I'm having sex.
- Stick the Booty out.
- Deeper! Yeah, buddy.
- [Grunts] - Like that.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Get it! Oh, my go- you're a.
Both: [Grunts] - [Grunts] My heart is racing, and I smell like king Kong's ass[Bleep].
- [Chuckles] - Where's my room? - Well, we have one extra bed in our room.
- Wait, there's a two-bedroom in there? There's a two-bed room, and there's one extra bed in our room.
- Do you want me to go with you guys? - Sure, why not? - He set that up.
Going into Jersey, I was definitely more into, like, the "Ronnie-type.
" But going into Italy, I'm definitely more into the "pauly-type.
" Like, pauly is lean, good-looking, - we're gonna hear deena bang dudes in her bed, yo.
- Maybe we could be, like, smush buddies.
You know, friends with benefits.
- What is that? - Don't ask what it is.
- Limoncello? - Don't ask what it is.
Limoncello.
- I like that stuff.
Me too.
First toast in Italy, it's only right to toast with limoncello.
- House shots! - It's an Italian drink, tastes like lemons.
It's really good, it's really strong.
We made it to Italy in one piece, we didn't lose not one baggage.
- Yay! All: [Chatter overlaps] - Salud! - [Speaking italian] - Salud, salud, salud - Yay! Cheers to another good time.
- Oh, yeah, it's warm.
- Oh, that's warm.
- Ugh! - Oh! It's bad warm.
That was bitter.
- Oh! - Bitter and sour.
- And yellow.
- [Laughing] - I need to get out of this house before I fall asleep.
- We're in Italy and it's 12:00 at night, but we don't care! - Your [Bleep] Are popping out of the side.
Did your boobs get bigger? I got smaller.
- They shrink when they're fake? - Oh, no.
Maybe my [Bleep] Fat got a little smaller.
ButThese [Bleep] Are, like, 700 ccs, and they're gonna stay 700 ccs.
- They don't shrink? - No.
- We should get fake boobs together.
- I want them.
- I'm scared of needles.
I just want them to not sag.
And the other one is bigger than the other, and it really pisses me off.
And and when I lay down, they go to the side.
- Ugh.
- It's annoying.
[Crackling] - Oh, [Bleep], it burnt out.
I got a crisis.
- You burn another converter or another blow-dryer? - No, another blow-dryer.
And I even switched it.
I changed their voltage, and it still burnt out.
- Yeah, you're supposed to.
- It burnt out? - I think.
- I'm in trouble.
- What voltage is it? - I don't know.
- If I can't blow-dry my hair - 'Cause is that 18,000? If your voltage is 1,600, you need a 2,000 voltage.
- I'm bringing them all, 'cause I gotta straighten this out.
Damn voltage [Hair dryer blows] Yeah, buddy, that's what I'm talking about.
- It works? - Hell, yeah.
I almost had a big blow-out.
- Do you guys wanna do another shot? - Let's do it.
I'm down.
- You're not taking a shot? - I won't wake up for the gym.
Change your jeans too? Wow, he changed the whole Jeez, he changed the whole stuff.
- Ron, we're not going to the club, relax.

[Crashing] - Whoa! - [Bleep] All: [Laughing] - Oh, my God.
- The best day of my life! That is the best day of my life! That is the best day of my life! [Laughing] Everything out here in Italy fits, like, 110-pound people.
Ronnie does not fit that description.
[Chuckles] He's a beast.
- Time to go.
- Ron! - Ron, what are you changing your shirt again? - Florence, Florence - First night in Florence.
- Florence.
All: [Laughing] if you could see the world - oh, what's that? What's that? - I kinda wanna look at that thing.
- Is this the Vatican? - Probably.
- Can we go in there? - I don't know.
- That looks like a painting, bro.
Oh, I love italia! Oh, wow, he's cute.
- He looks like a Metro.
- Yeah, that's my type.
- Is this the square right here? - Oh, my God! A Ferris wheel! Oh, my God, Ferris wheel! We want on the Ferris wheel.
- Ferris wheel.
All: [Screams] Faster, faster.

- No, it's this way.
- No, no.
- Go into this church- - go this way, go- yo, go this way.
Vinny, go this way.
- I thought snooks was single.
- No.
I feel like Mike wants to get it in.
Mike was saying, "oh, I thought Snooki was single?" [Speaking Italian] - What's he doing? What's he doing? I don't know.
Is that our house? - I feel like we should just make a right.
Swing to the right! You're stepping on me.
- This is beautiful.
[Chatter overlaps] - To the left! - This our house? [Knocking] - Ciao! - I cannot wait to go to the club.
Me, you, Vinny, and pauly.
- Mm-hmm.
- Are the single- like, and Sammi.
- Everybody's single.
- No, not snooks and Jen.
I thought snooks was single.
- No, but I love gianni for her, though.
I thought she was single - you thought Snooki was single? Yeah.
- But they - No.
- I think she's gonna be single out here.
- I don't think so.
- Nicole.
- No? - Mm-hmm.
- I'm a guy and I know that it just doesn't work like that.
But I'm a girl and I know.
- Well, I know-I know stuff that you don't know.
So - Everyone knows Nicole has a boyfriend.
I don't know what's going on with that.
I don't-I kinda feel like Mike wants to get it in.
- Mike was like, "oh, I thought Snooki was single.
" Just now.
I was like, "no.
" Why would he say that? - I don't know, why would he say that? - Eh! That's weird.
- Nicole's in a relationship with gianni, so Mike wants to ruin that.
There's, like, a switch in his head, like, it's like a disease.
That's what I felt like he was doing.
- Don't touch me.
Ew.
- I'm gonna pop it in there, yo.
Oh, make it rain, rain - You're getting drunk by yourself? - Yep.
- Weirdo.
- Me and Ron, I think we're kinda like avoiding each other.
Which is good.
I'd rather just keep it, like, separate.
- [Chuckles] - I'm gonna walk away, 'cause you guys are having a conversation.
- No, we weren't saying anything, like, crazy.
- I haven't seen Sam, actually, in, like, two or three months.
Still feelings there.
It's just that I feel like I'm-wanna have a good time and enjoy myself.
He's so gonna bang you.
He's gonna try to.
- I feel like he's gonna do his own thing.
No, I feel like, no.
- I feel like he's gonna try to woo you.
He's not gonna do it.
- What if he asked you on a romantic date? - Yeah, right.
Ron doesn't know how to do that.
[Farting sound] All: [Laughing] [Horn honks] - Wake up, brah! We're in Italy, you idiot.
Everybody needs to wake up, we're not sleeping away this time here in Italy.
[Grenade horn honks] Instead of a grenade whistle, we got this grenade horn.
[Grenade horn honks] I'm waking everybody up.
We need to hit g.
T.
L.
Good morning, Vincent.
Good morning, Vincent's beard.
Did you both sleep well? Let's have a meeting.
- I'm starving.
- I need to eat, bro.
Like, I have to eat.
- What's our street again? - "Viasta" or something.
- Well, they're all via.
- We don't even know how to read the map yet.
We don't even know how to ask questions about directions.
We should probably go to the closest- the closest place.
- I'm down.
- We better figure that stuff out before we go any further 'cause we're having problems with our map.
- Yo, this guy's gonna die.
- Let's go.
Let's just wing it, I'm down.
- Seriously.
Can you drive stick? I can.
- I can! - You're driving, let's go.
- Whoo! I'm driving! - Oh, my God, so We have to base our whole time here on Nicole and you? - Yes.
- I could teach you.
Finally, I'm useful for something, because I'm not useful for anything in this house.
But I can drive stick.
- Oh, my God.
But in Italy? - Listen - Really? - We got navigation, so wherever we gotta go just write down the address, that's it.
- I'm useful.
- Only one girl can drive.
And that's Nicole.
- We can only fit four people per car.
- I'm not looking forward to Nicole driving our car.
- Which one's mine? - That one's yours.
- This is it? - Oh, this [Bleep]'S dope.
- Three in front! - Wait, tell him not to go yet, I need to move this forward.
- We got it.
Should I give this to the girls? No, let them follow us.
- The navigation system in the car is in Italian.
I don't think the girls can understand the navigation system in English.
- Can you see if you can move my seat up forward? I feel like I need to scoot it up.
That's it.
- [Gasps] Whoa! - Oh, my God.
- Moving forward! Oh, my God, moving forward.
Is the car on? [Horn honking] - Wait, wait for the girls.
Wait for the girls.
We'll never get there.
- Can they wait? What're they doing? - Wait, am I gonna run over anybody? - Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, be careful.
This is [Bleep] Dope.
Normal people can't drive like this.
Yo, Snooki's definitely taking out some scooters.
- Scuzi.
- Go! - Policia.
- [Laughing] Where did the boys go? What does- does this mean to stop? - I don't know.
- What does this sign mean? - Looks like I'll be driving the whole trip.
- Like, Snooki's driving stick? [Horn honking] [Chuckles] Good luck with that.
- They're down there.
- They're down there.
[Chatter overlaps] - You have to do a u-ey.
[Sirens] - We're gonna die.
- Red light, okay? - Oh, sorry.
This is the last we saw them.
After this, I don't know.
[Speaking Italian] - Right here? Am I just allowed to go ahead? - You have to make a right I think.
- This place.
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
- I can't believe we got left like this.
On the first day.
- We need to go back to the house and get the address.
We're not in Jersey anymore.
- [Bleep] No.
- [Gps speaking Italian] - This thing doesn't even turn into English? [Horns honking] - I'm gonna tell you something, nobody knows about this Me and Snooki We kinda hooked up.
Oh, dear [Bleep], Nicole.
Well, that was something.
- Let's go shopping to get what we need.
Where else are we going? - We need, like, a food place.
Like, a quick cafe, right? - We lose the boys, and I'm just like, "you know what? Guys, I really wanna go to the gym," like, let's [Bleep] Eating, let's go to the gym, and that's it.
- I'm still like- my body's still exhausted- [Fluttering] All: [Screams] - No way.
I don't freakin' do birds.
I don't do birds.
Like, get off of me.
Who comes that close? - I just saw you guys scream, you scared the [Bleep] Outta me.
I didn't even know what it was.
[Fluttering] - Oh! - [Giggles] - This sucks.
- [Bleep] Don't do that! - These pigeons are ruthless in Italy.
Ugh! They will attack you, and they will bite your ears off.
[Flutters] - What the hell, dude! - What is wrong with you? - Stop.
- I feel like they just don't like you and they just wanna eat your food.
Who flies that close? - I think it's here.
Right here? This way.
Is it in here? - Hi.
- Hi.
- Speak English? - Eh, sorry, sir.
- Ended up going to the gym without the girls.
We lost them.
We got there, no problem.
- [Speaking italian] - Luigi.
- Pauly d.
- Luigi, the owner of the gym, he's a cool old Italian guy.
Just like one of my uncles or something back home.
[Speaking Italian] - Dude, what he got Ronnie doing? - Luigi is, like, the guido Mr.
miyagi.
He's this old guy that doesn't look like he ever worked out in his life- I think he was smoking outside at one point- yet, he kinda knows what he's talking about.
Wax on, wax off type of [Bleep].
Italian style.
High, high, high, high.
[Laughing] - [Laughing] - I want to eat somewhere.
You guys want to? - Dirtball isn't even the word right now.
- Yo, you guys took that one turn and that was it.
I'm working out.
- Snooks, you run up and down the stairs.
- I am.
- You strut your stuff! - Such an ass[Bleep].
- You strut it, Snooki.
- [Bleep] [Bleep] If I don't work out, like, once a day, I get into this mood.
- [Laughing] - Jerk.
Where I wanna kill somebody.
If you say something wrong to me, I will [Bleep] You up.
- Look at this girl.
- [Indistinct] That's the pelvic thrust.
Nobody bother me, please.
- So Snooki is, like, all about the gym.
And these little Snooki work-outs I've never seen before.
I got a good seat over here.
I don't know where Snooki got these work-outs from.
It looks like she's having sex with herself, I don't know.
[Chuckles] Oh, my God! - [Laughing] - Ew! - Dee, are you goin', like, full-blown tonight? Or you doing, like, cas? Think I'm gonna do full-blown.
I'm so excited to go out tonight.
I just wanna dance my ass off.
I'm gonna do the Jersey turnpike all over the place, and I wanna make out with people.
[Electrical buzz] - No! It's working? - Dude, if my [Bleep] Thing broke, I'll be so pissed right now.
[Exasperated sigh] There's no [Bleep] Outlets in this place.
I don't understand it.
Do Italians not believe in electricity? [Electrical buzz] Is one sucks! - My straightener's not going on.
- So you probably blew it.
- This is annoying.
- I know this is an old city, but come on, we need more outlets.
Works out here.
- It does? That's good.
- I can't do my hair in the kitchen.
We have no choice.
- Four girls with weave in their hair, doing it by the counter and fridge.
Talk about disgusting.
- I've never been so excited for a straightener.
- I am too.
- I'm gonna give it to you.
I'm getting ready, I'm straightening my freakin' hair Oh, why is it smoking? - Smoking? - What the hell? - Is it smoking? - Oh, God.
- It's really hot.
I put mine on, like, really hot.
- Sammi's straightener starts sizzling like mine was, and I'm like, whatever, just one more piece.
Like, waiting for my hair to go on fire.
[Sizzling] Oh, my God, no.
Burns? This is like, it really, like, took off my hair.
- [Gasps] - My hair came off of my head and onto this freakin' iron.
Like, it really just burnt off my hair.
- Yo, is-is-nobody is out there, outside, right? I'm gonna tell you something.
Nobody knows about this.
And you can't tell it to anybody, you know what I mean? Okay, me and Me and Snooki WeKinda hooked up.
Like, two- like, two, three months ago.
- Like, what the [Bleep] Is going on? She had the boyfriend.
We spoke about it And she was like She was like, "yeah, there was something there.
" - You don't want that anymore though, dog.
- Me and Snooki hooked up in Jersey.
We were drunk one night in L.
A.
and we sorta had sex.
[Chuckles] But the third or fourth time that we hooked up was recent.
And that's when she had the boyfriend.
And that's when supposedly it was serious.
I'll be honest, kinda just seeing her the last day or two, I'm not gonna lie, I kinda like I think I'm starting to like her a little bit.
- I'm like, mind-boggled, because I have a girl that calls her boyfriend when she wakes up, calls her boyfriend before she goes out, calls her boyfriend after she gets home.
But she's gonna hook up with you? She's gonna [Bleep] Up that situation for this situation? I'm a little iffy about that.
No, you can't say nothing.
But, you know, we're really tight right now.
And if you say something, you're gonna [Bleep] Up a lot of [Bleep].
- Give me a hug.
Give me a hug.

If I had those I would work with them too.
If deena's boobies could talk, they would say, "I'm a good time, I'm a blast in a bra.
" They look fake, right? It's fun.
- They look like fun bags.
- Oh, yeah! - Deena does have some cute attributes.
She got a fat ass, she got boobs But at the same time, like, she's just one of the guys.
[Speaking Italian] - [Speaking italian] That's all you gotta say.
Here is qui.
- Taxi arrivati, they have arrived.
- That means "they have arrived" but you don't say that.
You don't go, "cabs have arrived.
So in America, pauly's like, "cabs are here!" In Italy, Paul would be like, [Speaking Italian] [Speaking Italian] [Speaking Italian] - Ready, let's go, let's go.
[Speaking Italian] - We're going out to the club for the first time in Italy.

I actually looked to my left, and there's actually a cute girl there and I just waved her over, like, "come with me.
Come with the situation.
" Speak any English? - Um No, no, no.
She didn't speak a lick of English, and I had to go back and forth to pretty much Vinny to introduce and see if these girls wanted to hang out with us.
- she's movin' like you're still at the club what about her? - I am the ambassador to my roommates.
I'm the only one that speaks Italian, so all the guys in the house gotta come to me when they wanna say something to a girl, or know what a girl is sayin' back to them.
What do you want me to tell her? So I'm pretty much a necessity.
Maybe they'll get me free drinks for that.
- You like, you like? - you're the girl - ciao.
- I've been lookin' for all night - Vinny's the only way that the guys can get game to the girls in Italy.
Good luck.
Cheers to Italy! I love Italy! I'm enjoying myself.
I'm actually, like, happy for once.
I'm not tryin' to be miserable.
How many shots? No more tears for Sammi "sweetheart.
" - Italy! Whoo! - Italy, I feel like I'm coming into my own a little bit.

That's what I said.
It's like a me and Vinny situation.
Like I know what happened with me and Vinny, and it just kind of like ruined our friendship.
I don't want that to happen with deena and pauly.
I'm really just concerned that deena's gonna wake up tomorrow and be like, "I like pauly.

Whatever.
I'm-I-I-beg to differ.
I think there's a little something there.
And I-and if you don't think so, then you don't think so.
[Soft song] Oh, it ain't easy how can I be sure - Ronnie was so funny last night.
He said, "watch what happens, bro.
I got like five girls coming to the house right now.
" - I never said that you said you wanted to snuggle.
- Not what you said this morning.
- You're gonna go and put me on blast? Out everyone, really, pauly? Pauly sold her out.
- Is it still laundry and food? - Yeah, buddy.
- Are we all ready? - Hold on.
I'm coming.
- Ronnie! Ron! - All right, see ya.
- Wait.
Where's Snooki? - Nicole's sleeping.
Let's go.
[Speaking Italian] - Yo, Ronnie hit the concrete last night like a basketball.
Are you kidding me? - I don't want him and you being drunk.
You guys are a bad time, like for real.
- Stop it.
- I'm just telling you.
I'm telling you the truth.
When Ronnie and Sammi are drunk, they turn into different people.
There's no getting through to them.
- I went to bed.
I left the situation.
Normally, I would sit there and fight.
- Good.
Good for you.
You did the right thing.
Pauly said he's surprised nothing escalated.
It wouldn't have, though.
Like, I'm not gonna do that anymore like in Jersey.
- Why can't you guys just say [Bleep] It and have a good time and not- - you know what the thing is? You both need to go out and not worry about what each other is doing.
- This needs to stop.
You people are in high school.
You need to grow up, and you need to find a happy medium.
- I have feelings for Ron.
I always will.
So it's hard living with your ex-boyfriend and going out and dealing with this.
It's just difficult.
And I'm dealing with it the best way I can.
I think I've been doing pretty [Bleep] Good.
- I just wanted to be open and honest, like whatever I say to anybody else, I'm saying to you.
- Ronnie was so funny last night.
He was like, "watch what happens, bro.
" He was like, "I got like five girls coming to the house right now.
" - Mike always has to cross that line.
We had squashed a beef, but Mike's trying to start problems.
Like he was just drunk.
He didn't know what was going on, you know what I mean? Obviously, there wasn't, you know? - Whatever happens happens.
Ron can do whatever he wants.
I'm not gonna let the whole Ron thing really get to me.
Just not.
- Ready to go? Let's go.
- Yeah.
- Ciao.
[Pop music] - Ron, you wanna go in? - Nah - I'll go in naked with you if you want.
- In that case, then I'll do it, yeah.
Vinny's like, you know, I really wanna go in the jacuzzi.
I'm like, you know what, [Bleep], vin.
I'll get in there with you.
[Bleep].
- It's like a pot.
- Ha ha! I feel like I'm in chicken soup.
Soup with the muscles.
[Laughing] [Folksy Italian music] This could be real romantic.
Turn the lights off in this place, dog.
- Oh, don't [Bleep] Try to pull anything on me, bro.
- It's like hard to be in a jacuzzi with two guys.
- Yeah, it keeps like pushing me towards you.
It's like a love cozy, becauseIt gravitates you toward each other.
[Folk tune playing, guys laughing] I give up.
It's definitely a jacuzzi for a guy and a girl so that you guys can get close.
- Are you going to sleep? - Yeah.
- Is this bed big enough? Hey, smooch over.
- Ooh.
- Oy.
Comfortable, right? Mike got into my bed and tried to like cuddle with me.
And I'm kind of like, ehh.
'Cause me and Mike really aren't like that.
Actually, I'm falling off.
- Come on.
- Ugh.
Do you wanna smoke? Yeah.
You going to bed? Yeah, I'm going to bed.
Good night.
- Yo, fellas, we're gonna go eat with the girls.
This matches with the gold glasses, gold watch.
Yeah, buddy.
Fresh from the feetUp! Let's go.
- Mike.
- Yeah.
- We're rolling out, son.
- All right.
I gotta change my sneakers, that's all.
- How about Mike last night? [Laughs] Did you see him? [Laughter] - Oh, my God, like When he came in? He's weird! - What happened? - He came on my bed like, "let's cuddle," and I was like- I looked around, and I looked at him and I was like, "I think I need to go smoke a cigarette.
" [Laughing] - Mike! - I'm coming right now.
Hold on.
Oh, it's beautiful out.
Which cafe we going to? This way.
Thank God for vincenzo.
- We're here! - Oh, we made it.
- I love Rome! I mean Italy.
[Laughing] - They bring us up to the rooftop, and it was just like I love Florence it's my best thing - Look how the sun is just shining on the church.
What's that church called? - Where someone just got married.
- It starts with a "v".
Vatican.
- Vatican.
That's the one that Leonardo di vinci painted with his hand.
- I'm pretty sure it was Michelangelo.
Thanks for correcting me.
- What'd you drink last night, 'cause you were - Yeah, what was good with you last night, bro? - They said you tried to cuddle with deena, she turned you down.
No.
I said you got on the bed and then we went to smoke a cigarette.
- That's messed up-not what you said this morning.
- Not this morning.
- Shut up! - I'm just saying what she said.
- Really? - No.
That's not what I said.
What'd you say, then? - I said that he was drunk and he was trying to cuddle.
- Oh, all right.
- What are you talking about? I wasn't trying to cuddle with you.
- Is this bed big enough? Smooch over? - Ooh.
- Oy.
Comfortable, right? - Why are you trying to say- - I wasn't- that didn't happen.
I said you got in my bed and you were like, "move over.
Can we both fit?" I said no.
- It was no like.
.
"Mike wanted to snuggle, and I said no.
" - No, I never said you wanted to snuggle.
- Okay.
'Cause I don't want to, just so you know.
- 'Cause that didn't- - oh! Wow! - Pauly, you're supposed to be my best friend, and you're gonna go and like put me on blast and make me feel like [Bleep]? Out of everyone, really? Pauly? - I hate seeing her upset, 'cause it's not her at all.
It was really that bad? Yes! Pauly sold her out.
And she was like, "come on, pauly, stop, I didn't say that," and he was like, "no, but you did.
" Like.
.
He threw her under the bus.
I think pauly knows, like he's not stupid, deena is in love with him, and if you do something like that, deena's gonna, you know, be very upset.
- You all right, Dee? - Yeah, I'm fine.
- Take a shot? - Nah.
- Give her a shot.
- Yeah, take it.
- Deena needs to lighten up and relax.
It's not that big a deal.
Okay, so sitch did want to snuggle with you or didn't- who cares? Viva la italia! Salud.
I miss you.
I just want to go in the bed and cuddle with you.
- I'm just like [Bleep] Me in the [Bleep] With a spike bat.
I'd rather not do that.
Is everybody going? Everybody here's going.
- Boo, are you going? - Yes! Watch your [Bleep] Tone.
No, I'm going.
- Here's a fist-pumping Pinocchio.
- You understand why I got mad at you, though, right? - Yep.
Won't happen again.
Oh, I got you something.
Ah! What is it? Italian bracelet.
- Oh! - Aw! Pauly got me a bracelet to apologize.
- I'm sorry.
- Love you.

My feet already hurt.
Yo, we're leaving.
- Round and round and round dance, we can pull the music to my head to my head, to my music is my drug, my drug, my drug - Whoa! [Thud, crash] - Cheers, bitch! - Whoo! Whoo! We were poppin' bottles.
We're finally fist-pumping, you know.
We're in a crowd jumping.
And it's kinda feeling like we're in Jersey again.
Discotheque! [Dance music] - The girls are super-young out here.
Yo, if she stillas coloring books, she's too young for you, man.
I don't think they have to be a certain age to drink, so if the girls are young, just check their I.
D.

- White boy wasted.
- Please! - I'm [Bleep] Up, Ron.
I'm [Bleep] Up.
- Come on.
Let's go to the bathroom.
- Listen, I don't want to ruin your time.
I know I'm annoying.
I know I'm bothering you no stop.
- Sam! - I know.
- Sam approaches me, and she's just like, "I want to talk.
" I can't wait anymore.
- I know, but I don't want to do this right now.
- Me and Sam drunk, having conversations about our relationship- that's definitely not the best time to have a conversation.
Samantha! - Listen, Ron- - I can't, Sam.
- , look at me, look at me, look at me.
- No.
You want to do this now.
I don't want to do this now.

So it's like a [Bleep] Up position.
So I don't want to do this now.
So have fun with deena, and enjoy yourself.
I think Sam is just drunk, and I think she's very focused on like what Ronnie's doing.
And I'm just like, "no," like"Come with me.
" I want to be friends.
Ron! - I don't know why you don't listen to me.
- Are we ready to go? Are we ready to go? - Yes.

What are you doing? These [Bleep] Stalker twins keep calling the house for Mike, so I decided to play a prank on Mike.
- Are you guys gonna hang out with me? - Yeah, we can hang out if you want.
Um - Um - Come with your sister and meet me at the house.
Like an hour? - Okay, that sounds good.
Okay.
- Bye-bye.
- Is she really coming? - She's really gonna come.
- Yeah, buddy.
Mike is in bed sleeping right now.
He has no idea what's about to happen.
I didn't think Ronnie had it in him, but he came up with a good prank.
Okay, let's go.
We can go eat.
- I turn around and I see Whoa, whoa, whoa.
The twins.
I get to walk in the middle.
- If you're gonna try for something, two hot twins and a threesome's worth trying for.
Well, we can start now.
Deena.
- What the hell goes on in this house? - I was waiting for you.
- I'm sorry, babe.
I "misses" you.
- I didn't go out.
- You didn't? - No.
- What the? - What? - What the hell? - What are you saying? Nothing.
Why are they here right now? It's daytime.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Guess who? Um I turn around, and I see the twins.
- The twins.
- Hey, guys, how are you? And I was like, oh, my God, they found me.
Wow.
Um, I didn't even say hello to you.
Hi.
- Hi.
You told me to come in an hour.
I feel bad you're not ready.
- No, that's okay.
Hi.
- Hey.
- How are you? - Good.
- Uh, yeah.
You know what? Um, if you guys want, you can wait, um, in here.
I have no idea how they got there, but, uh, I just go with the flow and say, "all right, girls, I guess we're going out for breakfast.
" Pronto, pronto.
- Chill right here and just give me a couple of minutes to get dressed.
I'm so confused right now.
- How's your beard? What's up, buddy? Yo, jenni.
Oh Yeah.
Dude, who did this? - I was getting dressed, and all of a sudden the two twins walked in, and I'm like, I didn't like invite 'em.
I mean, I don't remember, you know, inviting them.
- She's crazy.
Like, they're really waiting.
- I know they are.
- On the couch, waiting.
I know they are.
- She wants to know where she can put her toothbrush.
- Thanks, dog.
- You're welcome, homey.
- I'll be honest with you, twins are not a bad deal.
They're really not a bad deal.
- If you've got to try for something, two hot twins and a threesome's worth trying for.
If I pull your hair, will she feel it? - You can try it on her.
- You bitch.
- I'm kidding.
- If she's a bitch, then you're a bitch.
- Come on, girls, let's go.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Ciao.
- We'll go get food, then we'll walk through the market.
Breakfast? Mike definitely has an agenda and he has a secret motive with these twins.
- Hey, I get to walk in the middle.
- Because Mike never takes girls out on dates, especially in the daytime.
You said you're a virgin.
- She is.
- It's it's cool to be a it's cool.
Own it.
- A threesome is not an easy task to accomplish, but then again, The Situation does the impossible, and I think I can get it done.
- I need a drink.
Well, we can start now.
We can start now.
D, it's so nice up here.
The restaurant is in a complete romantic spot.
It's on a rooftop.
You can watch the sun set.
I kind of got butterflies.
Like, you're not really romantic, Ron, and you're taking me there? So I'm excited.
So - You wanted to talk, so - I just feel like I haven't really been able to talk to you since I've been here.
I'm listening.
- Okay, but let me be hon I feel I feel like I'm not that girl from Jersey and I think, like, I know what I want in my life.
And I'm letting you do you and, like, I'm giving you trust that you wouldn't bring back a girl or, like, hurt me, and you haven't yet.
- What more could you want from a guy? I hung out with the guys the whole night.
- I want you to hang out with them.
- But do you get where I'm coming from? I'm kind of torn because it's like, I kind of want to be with Sam, but I want Sam to be this girl.
- I'm a completely changed person.
I like who I am.
- So no more bull.
No more, like, Nonsense.
- I don't want you to worry 'cause, like, I'm not ever gonna hurt you.
If you want to me with me, like, yeah, like, I'm here.
Like, I've obviously been here.
- All right, so then We'll give it a shot.
Well, how do you feel? - Well, obviously, I love you, Sam.
I miss that feeling of holding you and, like, being with you.
- I guess that we should start over.
Okay.
Look how romantical that is.
- I feel like, uh, like, this is heaven.
I haven't felt this happy in, like, 20 years.
I'm not even kidding you.
You sure you're happy? - Yeah.
Living in the moment and all your hopes arrive today - I guess this means Ron and Sam are back together.
- You need a mint.
Do you have any altoids? - I need a m I need a mint? - Do you have an altoid? You need one.
- Hey, guys, deena's making out with the twin right now.

We hooked up two months ago.
You're psycho! - Two months ago.
- You're psycho! They say we're crazy 'cause we act like we do they say it's meaningless This is the first time I've seen you smile in a long time.
- With Sam I feel like this time is gonna be different.
I definitely feel like we can move forward from the past.
- How was dinner? - Good.
- I think it's definitely weird that I miss Ron and Sam's drama, because when they don't fight it's just like this is boring, like I need something! Did you have a good talk? - Yeah.
Things are good.
And? - Working it out.
- And? Back together.
- You are? - Yeah.
- Ohh - No fighting this time, though.

Did you ask Sam first? "Sam, can I get changed?" She's back in black, bro.
She's not wearing colors anymore! - Oh, my God, she was wearing colors all year! Conservative Sammi she's a wonderful girl - I said if Ron and Sam get back together after all the [Bleep]'S said and done, I will kill myself.
When you're thinking suicide on sebody else's relationship, that's how bad it is.
- When they're together, they both wear black.
It's like a funeral.

- I don't give a! N't [Bleep] A relationship.
You [Bleep] Serious? - And I'm likeUh-oh.
- Let's do it! - Stop! Let's do it! 
DJ Pauly Delvecchio! - I'm going to Jersey shore, bitch! - All right, we got a situation.
- I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
- After I have sex with a guy, I will rip their heads off.
Go, Vinny! Go, Vinny! Do you like the boobs? What? Well, I'm going home.
Peace out.
- It was supposed to be a menage a twin, but my whole menagerie went awry.
I still had one twin.
Can't be that upset, you know what I mean? Si.
- I want to know what happened.
- Do you want me to tell you? - Yeah.
- This chick wants to [Bleep] Me.
I was like, "whatever.
" So we're, like, doing it, blah, blah, blah.
And then deena walks in the room and pulls the sheets up.
And then she [Bleep] Takes the girl and put-in her bed.
She was hooking up with her all night, and, like, she got off.
And then she sent the girl back to my bed.
And then the girl polished me off.
The truth is me and deena did tag-team a girl.
What the hell? - But robbing is not teamwork.
It's called "tag team," not "tag rob.
" It wasn't a good tag team.
I'm sitting here.
- So what did you guys hear today? - Why? Tell me what you heard.
- The girl was [Bleep] Vinny.
She took the girl out of Vinny's bed the girl went [Bleep] On her.
- Wait, [Bleep] On deena? - On deena, yeah.
Vinny listened to the whole thing.
Yeah.
- Ew! Stop.
You gotta do sound effects, Ron? - Now I got visuals.
- I know.
- Deena's like, "ooh!" - Yo, pump up, bro.
We gotta go.
Yeah, buddy.
You don't know what went down, son.
This guy's mid hook-up.
She throws the blanket right off 'em.
She's like, "oh, come with me.
I'm better.
" - That's [Bleep] Up.
- She pulled a robbery.
Oh, God! - What goes on in that house, dude? Wow.
Like - So what happened? How'd you guys end off with the fight with snook? You guys apologize? - Uh, pretty much.
Like- - you guys are not talking now.
We didn't talk yet.
- Drama as usual at the house last night.
Mike told everybody that Snooki hooked up with him and cheated on jionni.
- So what happened now? What happened now? - Pretty much my boy unit was banging ryder.
Mm-hmm.
- And then Snooki walked in and got all turned on.
And immediately got on her.
- Wow.
You swear to God? I swear my sister.
Sometimes the truth hurts, but I'm gonna bring the truth to the people.
I'm the people's champ.
Today's Sunday dinner.
So what's gonna happen at Sunday dinner? I don't know.
- The only thing I can say is I love it this time of year! - Can we all do the silent treatment tonight? Why? What happened? - I need to talk over a glass of wine.
- Right here.
It's literally right there.
Okay.
- I don't want to talk to Mike.
I'm over it.
There's nothing more I can say.
- Is that bridge burned, or is it repairable? - Burned.
You know he loves to fight.
I'm not doing that.
That's not me.
I don't even know what the Is wrong with Mike.
Like, you know I love jionni.
I tell you all the time I miss him, and then you're gonna tell everyone behind my back we hooked up two months ago.
You're crazy.
I'm not losing jionni over this bull-.
- Upsetting you to the end.
- Don't.
I hope not.
She's done nothing wrong.
If he wants to leave her over someone running his mouth, then they shouldn't be together.
- I think it's gonna be rough when you first tell him.
- Mike's planning to ruin my relationship.
I think that shows what kind of person you are, and you're a [Bleep bleep] Person.
So, Sunday dinner.
- I don't want to eat with any of them.
You know what I don't like? Have you heard them talking [Bleep] At all? - Boys will talk.
Girls will talk.
Everybody talks in this house.
Like, everybody's like, "deena's having a lesbian moment.
" I was making out.
- Did you do anything to her, though? - No.
- Like her nipple? No.
Then after, I was like, "okay, you can go into Vinny's bed.
" And then he went-she went and she hooked up with vin.
- Vinny got your sloppy seconds.
- Oh! - There you go.
- I had a lesbianic experience.
When you're drunk, it's fun.
- I licked a nipple once.
It was weird.
You were young when you made your path the first ever you came across - Ugh, you smell that? Horse poop.
- Look at its ding-dong.
- That's disgusting.
- That's too much.
- Too big? - Jenni, you look like an idiot.
- Y'all don't understand Italian fashion.
How do you see? - All right, well, I like Jersey fashion.
Whoa-oh-oh oh-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh-oh oh oh whoa-ohh-oh - Oh, the stairs almost killed me.
- At least the carpets are extra clean today, you know what I mean.
That's all I'm sayin'.
Come on, lez-be-honest.
Lez-be-honest.
- About what? - This sauce.
I wasn't talking about you.
Holy.
You gotta take it a easy a notch.
- I think, it's, like, really screwed up that, like, the boys are all, like, judging me for, like, hooking up with this girl.
Until you know something for a fact, don't talk [Bleep], and that's all.
And you know what? It was a good [Bleep] Time.
Save it for dinner.
- This is going to be the best dinner of my life.
Mike was like, "yeah, I wanna hook up with you, blah, blah, blah.
" I need to tell jionni what's going on right now.
Well, last night, he told all the roommates that we had sex.
Talk to me, please.
- I'm gonna Him up.
- Yo, I don't get involved in your [Bleep] Relationship! Are you [Bleep] Serious? Let's do it! Stop! - At least the carpets are extra clean today.
- Until you know something for a fact, don't talk.
- Because I'm putting you back in your place - This is gonna be the best dinner of my life.
Mike.
Yo, make me dinner, son.
Come on.
- Don't put too much onions in the sauce.
Nicole! Do you want us here or no? - I need to tell jionni what's going on right now.
I cannot have Mike ruin my relationship.
Thanks, broads.
- Hello.
- Hi, babe.
What are you doing? - So, um, you know how, like, me and Mike, we've been close, like Come to find out, he's talking About me the last two days, saying, "oh, well, Snooki likes me.
We hooked up two months ago.
" What's he talking about? - In December, ryder and Mike's friend hooked up.
And Mike was like, "yo, I wanna hook up with you, blah, blah, blah.
" I wouldn't hook up with him, so he was, like, pissed off that he didn't get with me.
And then, last night, he told all the roommates that we had sex.
What are you thinking right now? Talk to me, please.
- If you have something to hide then I'd rather you- - I don't.
Trust me.
I would tell you so I don't embarrass you.
Did you hook up with him? No.
I don't want you to be mad at me.
That's all I'm worried about.
Tell me you love me, and everything's fine.
I love you.
Okay.
We're fine.
Baby, I miss you a lot.
And I miss you more.
- I'm gonna be there in three weeks, baby.
Let's have babies.
Are you out of your mind? Yeah.
- You outdone yourself, my dude.
- I'll wear my black floppy hat.
At dinner, we all decided to dress up like 40-year-olds from the yonkers.
So it's like the big hats and with the boobs out.
I just love role playing.
All right.
My bazooka's out.
Excuse me! - Oh, my God! No manners over here! No, never.
No shame.
- It smells phenomenal in here.
Oh, it's gorgeous.
- The girls with their hats, they looked like the Kentucky derby The easter bunny.
It's flo and Nancy time.
- Fland Nancy, Marge and Marie.
- Fodinner.
- Are there lemons over there? They're right here.
- No, wait, these aren't lemons.
These are melons.
Another Sunday dinner.
Sunday dinner is crazy awkward 'cause there's mad Going on in the house right now.
We got Snooki and situation drama, and then we got deena, cuca if she really got The drama.
Cricket? Awkward, weird.
Boo.
- That girl, Erica, called before, but I didn't know who she's calling for, Vinny or you.
I didn't know who she was calling for.
I don't know.
We heard you were moaning all night.
- She didn't Down there.
She went to, and then I decided I didn't want to do that.
Now I realize I was a little bi-curious, and I've realized I do like boys.
I always said if I was to ever be bi-curious, it would be with a hot blonde.
I thought she was adorable.
How did you like her, vin? - Oh.
- Wow! - She jumped out of vin's bed to go into your bed, or you went and got her? - I got her.
- You rapina'd.
You did the robbery.
- Rapina.
Deena has a criminal record of [Bleep] Blocking now.
This is a serious offense and it's gonna be on her record for at least seven years.
I don't think there's anything wrong with girls kissing each other, but I do think it's wrong, what happened last night.
Who are you to judge? - If somebody's in somebody's bed, you don't go and grab them, you know what I mean? That's just proper etiquette.
- You've done the robbery on Vinny so many times.
- No, I've never had a robbery.
You know I've never had a robbery.
Busted! Big time! Yep! - We just hate Blockers.
That's what we.
- I'not a [Bleep] Blocker, and I gave her back after.
- Next time, like, I might like the girl, so don't, like, just lift up the covers and take her, you know what I'm saying.
Whatever.
So what else is going on? That's pretty much it.
Yeah, that's it.
That's it, that's it, yeah.
That's it.
- I need you to be a part of my soul can barely see the light in daunting night - Whatever happened last night happened.
Who cares? They're, like, crazy.
I thought my relationship with the boys was different, but, clearly, it's not.
- To them, you crossed the line when you hooked up with that chick.
And to them, it was [Bleep] Blocking.
So now, they're going to be the way they are.
- I don't know if I'm gonna be able to handle this.
No, you can.
You're fine.
- Like, I feel like now, I'm just, like Like, losing myself.
She basically did us dirty.
Seriously.
I'm fine, I don't know.
I don't.
I have no- - she thinks she's not wrong, and she ain't apologized.
Should we move her bed out? Dude.
- Imagine? Yeah, we should.
That would be- - We got a problem with deena.
I mean, she did the robbery.
It is what it is, but all this drama's too much for me, so we decide to pull a prank, put her bed in the living room.
- You've been raised to be a good schoolboy they say they guarantee rewards - That was the best day of my life.
- They want and you can do exit, exit, exit, exit - So, how about them, uh, firenze? - Yo, I probably busted my ass.
What is that? - They took my bed out and everything.
And I walk out, and I see my bed on the floor, and that just killed me.
Like, Pauly, I've known for almost a year now, and, like, after a week, you're gonna, like, change your entire thoughts about me? Like, it hurts.
Why would you do that? That's just malicious.
Honestly? - We were only kidding with that.
It's a joke.
- You're such a [Bleep], bro.
I don't know, bro, but ever since you had that beard, you changed.
- I don't want this girl having nervous breakdown.
Like, I'm a real person.
I'm not.
Come here.
- I'm having an anxiety attack.
Breathe.
You are not the same person.
- Don't put the [Bleep] Issues on me.
You [Bleep] Changed.
- It'd be better if I was there? - Yeah, it'd be way better of you were here.
- Ron has been calling this girl, Hannah, that I kind of know about.
I want to talk to you.
It seemed like there were many phone calls made.
She thinks she's not wrong, and she didn't apologize.
What is that? Find another one like you oh-oh find another love Why'd you do that, bro? - You want to move the frame, too? - All right, let me get it.
- I'm having an anxiety attack.
Breathe.
It's gonna be okay.
Just breathe.
I wanna go home! - If it's a joke, can you tell her that? Like, this poor girl is hysterically crying now.
- Vinny made me do it.
- Whatever.
So you're even making her walk out now? You're such a [Bleep], dude.
Why can't you be serious with anybody? Come on, man.
- You're defending the same girl that does something stupid every night, then cries about it the next day.
- What's wrong with her being human, like? - I reacted to what the hell she did.
- You move on, you [Bleep] Another girl, and she moves on.
- I'm just saying, like, I played a prank because she did that.
- Putting a couch on her bed is funny.
Removing her bed after an argument? We did that as a joke.
It's three feet away from the door.
You know what? I'm gonna get her, and we're gonna talk.
Absolutely.
Deena, let's go.
I give up.
- Babe? Pauly and everyone want to talk to you.
No.
- Deena thinks the guys are talking Behind her back.
The boys are thinking deena's being Overemotional and crazy.
Deena, let's go.
Come on.
They need to talk it out and figure out what's going on.
Tell them what's up.
Tell them how you really feel.
- You are not the same person as you are outside of this house.
- Different? The only thing different is you.
You changed.
You were never this emotional before.
The reason why I loved you because you could take our jokes and give them right back to us.
That was the best.
You would never [Bleep] Block anybody in this whole House.
You were the coolest girl.
Like, you were mad cool.
You [Bleep] Changed.
You were the biggest team player in the house.
Not anymore, you changed.
It's not me.
I never changed since day one.
I'll never change, ever.
- Enough with the [Bleep] Blocking stuff.
- I never-that was a different-that was not you.
You don't hook up with girls, but I don't care.
I mean, that was a joke, I mean, that's fine.
Every single girl I know hooks up with girls.
That's fine.
- I don't know what's going on.
I'm not being myself.
- Exactly! So don't put the [Bleep] Issues on me! Don't say it's me.
It's you.
- Like, I would've never done that.
- I know it's not you.
Like, I know.
That isn't me.
I feel very, like, alone here, and I'm, like, just drinking, and then I do stupid Like I did last night.
And I just-instead of, like, fixing it, I just keep drinking.
- But if you have your own issues, please, I wish you would've told me.
Like, "yo, I got problems.
You gotta lay off the jokes or something.
" 'Cause sometimes my jokes are harsh, and then you did that thing with him, and you said you were wrong, and you never apologized.
Why? Well, I apologize, vin.
Thank you.
- And we're over it, so we're not - Well, I'm good.
.
- We're fine now.
- I do not hold any resentment.
We don't hate you at all.
We only moved the bed as a joke.
That was only-sometimes, we push the limit, but - Like, you just didn't know how I felt, I guess.
So make a change.
You have so much time still to just - And we'll help.
- Exactly.
And talk to us.
- Just whatever you do, don't take any advice from Sammi.
Oh, my God.
See what I mean.
- Okay.

Even when I'm drunk, like, I look around, I'm like, "all right.
" Wait a second.
Yeah, you'll see the pizza sign.
Yup, see? Good job.
Thank God for deena, or we'd be [Bleep] Ending up in Rome at this point.

- Hi, ladies.
- Best pizza in the world.
Thank you.
- Where are you going tonight? - Oh.
- Passing out flyers is the best way to meet girls, 'cause literally it gives me a reason to go up to the girls and find out what their plans are for the night.
If you don't come back, I'll find you.
- Oh, really? - I live out here now.
What's Pauly doing? Just standing out there for his good looks? - Where are you from? - Uh, england.

You'd probably live at the same house, though.
That might be an issue.
Is that cool? - I know that Ron has been calling this girl, Hannah, from long island that I kind of know about.
- I don't care if Ron's Another girl in the other room.
I just don't want Drama, because I don't want it to ruin our time.
I want to talk to you.
Me? - I knew that you were talking a lot to a Hannah.
It seemed like there was many phone calls made, so I don't know.
Jenni's my friend, but it's not your business, not your relationship.
Keep your nose out of other people's relationships.
- I just wanted to make sure.
She's not coming or anything, though, right? I started fresh with her.
If it doesn't work out, it don't work out.
That's the way you do it.
- Keep it moving? I just wanted to - It's the way it should be.
- See if everything's okay.

- What are you doing, sleeping? - No, I didn't hear you call.
- The pizza's ready.
- Having to sit there forever wasting your days away Don't mind me, now.
I just gotta clean these [Bleep] Plates.
- Mmm, that's prpretty good, though.
Between meatballs at work today, I realized that this is going to be a miserable job.
We could fit both of us in this bag.
- Yeah, okay.
It's not joke.
Just meatballs in a bag.
- Okay.
- Okay? How much longer do we got? Soon.
I need a wine.
I can't take this.
Will you look for a wine with me real quick? Of course.
- Guh, guh, guh.
Let's just get a little buzz on.
- I'll be on the lookout.
You watch here.
- The wine case is, like, right behind the counter, so I'm like, "how the Am I gonna do this?" Marco's like a Nazi, first of all.
So I go to a customer.
Can you get one for us? I'll give you money.
Okay.
- Two? - Two, yeah.
And come to the back, by the bathroom.
Yes.
Whoo-hoo! Holla.
She buys us a bottle of wine.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Grazie.
Oh, keep it.
So, I'u, like, really crazy right now with the wine.
I mean, I just love Italy wine.
Me and deena just start chugging.
Nicole and Deena.
Nicole! Deena! - Coming.
She just has her period.
I have my "perioso.
" Open the door.
- Vinny! Did you saw the beach in Italy? - I don't speak Italian fluently, but there is an international language of love.
I don't want to screw you! Nicole! Deena! - Coming.
She just has her period.
Open the door.
She has her period.
She has her period? I gave her a tampon.
- All right.
- Let's work! Maybe that's yours.
- That's not mine.
- Sure? Positive.
Maybe that's yours.
No, no.
No? That's not ours.
- I don't drink a white wine.
After, we need to talk, okay? - That's weird.
- That's not good job.
- Oh, my God! Marco wasting all that wine is definitely alcohol abuse, because I could have drank that.
Well, this job sucks.
Scusi.
- No.
- What's up? - I think today was good that we hung out and stuff.
Now I feel, like, ten times better.
I do, too.
Ew.
- Ew, did you just get pooped on? - Mm-hmm.
- That's good luck.
It is? - Yeah, but don't put it near me.
Pauly got pooped on.
Keep going straight.
The white one.
- Me and Ronnie today are walking around.
Ron's, like, buying [Bleep] For Sam, which is really sweet.
She likes stuff like this.
But I'm just kind of concerned that this guy knows what he's doing.
- Yeah, the whole [Bleep] Thing is I called her once, like, on the first night, and I was piss drunk, yadda yadda.
- I don't give a Either way.
I just don't want to be blindsided.
I know.
Ciao.
Baby.
You bought me stuff? Oh, my God.
Look at this.
I love this.
Sure.
Thank you.
- I actually bought Sam something for no reason, just to see her smile on her face.
- You picked this out? - Yeah.
- Like, yourself? Like, you picked this whole thing out? Yeah.
- Oh, I'm so excited right now.
I felt, like, my heart, like, melt.
I love this.
I'm, like, completely head over heels in love with Ron just by the way he's just changed.
Thank you so much.
Aw, the love birds.
I like you these days.
I'm hungry.
- Do you want me to wear one of your dresses or no? Wear whatever you want.
- After what went down with Mike, I don't want to see his face.
I just want nothing to do with him, so me and jenni decide to go out to dinner by ourselves.
- May we have extra lemon, please? Lemons? That's great.
- May we have two more plates, please? Maybe a little water.
Can we have a little extra marinara? - Jenni is With this waiter.
- Sorry.
We're a pain in the butt.
- I just think it's funny.
It's like my entertainment.
- Did you make a list for jionni? To bring stuff? Well, I just said, you know, "bring my clothes and your penis, and that's all I need.
" Oh, my God, like, I miss smushing.
I miss having sex.
Like, what the Am I gonna do? - You should get a dildo made.
- Oh, like a Clay of his penis? Mm-hmm.
- I never knew that you can mold somebody's penis.
It's like he'll always be with me.
I might do it.
I'll do that.
- Turn Roger into a vibrator.
Will you show me his? We can compare.
Just asking.
- As of right now, me and Sam are happy with each other.
And it's like, we're in Italy.
Let's be romantic.
Let's go out.
Let's go to dinner.
Ciao.
- Ciao.
- Uh, two? - Due.
Si, grazie.
Prego.
- Thank you for today, like, all the stuff.
You're welcome.
- It feels like when you first go out with somebody and you have, like, those feelings where all you wanna do is you just, like, hug and kiss.
I'm actually glad that the drama has nothing to do with us.
- That's what I've been saying, dude.
I was actually at the table with the guys the other day, and I was like, "for the first time, the drama isn't about me and Sam.
" - We had forgot what it was like to have fun, and I'm just really focusing on that.
Are we gonna get it on tonight? Winning.
Ew.
Ew, please don't do that.
Now, there's one issue that I don't know how to deal with.
You remember Hannah? Ron called her and said that he was flying her out here.
I didn't know that.
- But, I mean, it's gonna come out.
Should I just let it be? We'll type an anonymous letter.
"Ron made out with two girls.
" - Who wrote the note? You two! - Did you grow some balls all of the sudden? - People become [Bleep], too! Aah! Let it be.
You bring it up again, it's gonna be a whole Miami thing that we said we would never do.
- Yet again, I'm the one that gets to find out about the Other chick.
Let it be.
- Broken flowers lookin' to fall I like us like this.
Me, too.
Words were sweet they were wrong I look for you in parts and on trains - I'm tired of you trying to check me.
I'm gonna check you soon.
Me and Sam are just like throwing kerosene into a fire.

The girls are a mixture of Italian girls, American girls, older girls, younger girls.
Vinny! Did you-did you saw the beach in Italy? No, noI don't see.
My eyes are always open to gls that I have to speak Italian to, because it's a challenge, you know what I mean? - You have to go at least one day! - I don't know, I don't know.
- Don't know? What do you do mean, "you don't know? " I don't know! I don't speak Italian fluently, but there is an international language of love.

I swear to God! - You don't really wanna get left behind can't find your way, can't find your mind through the prism, through the prism Wait, where's Ronnie? Laser beams, light flare - Right now, I'm having a good time, and I'm not gonna do what I always do.
When I'm back with Sam, it's all about Sam, Sam, Sam.
And I don't want to do that here in Italy.
- Short circuits when I shock the system What is this girl doing? - I'm dancing, like, three feet above some fat chick, and Sam just gives me a dirty look.
Through the prism through the prism - I guess Sam thought she was trying to dance with me.
Sam gets mad.
Shocking.
Come on! - Babe.
Babe, come here.
I want to talk to you like a normal person.
Look.
I'm the type of person where, like, if something's bothering me, I can't just seem to let it go.
I have to try and fix it at the time, especially when I'm drunk.
I saw what I saw, and, like, it bothered me.
- You see me go Like this on a table - And a blonde girl before that.
- A blonde? You are out of your [Bleep] Mind! Me and Sam talking when we're drunk is like throwing kerosene into a fire.
I don't know why I give in to this.
And I've been told by many people that I don't deserve it.
- Really? - Yeah, really! - So, I'm the [Bleep] Idiot? - Really! - I apologize.
You're not doing anything wrong.
- How many times can you apologize for the same thing? - Okay, then don't be with me, but I'm telling you I'm sorry.
- Well, this isn't gonna work out 'cause you don't trust me.
So how about that? She got mad at me tonight for some bull.
And at this point I was like, "I can't deal with this anymore.
" It's like you're acting like the same person that I left five months ago, and this is the reason why I left you.
She don't Deserve me.
- I forget the world when I hear the dj play the perfect record that'll take it away I'm in the back of the club with the whole crew - As usual, I'm nabbin' girls, more than one.
Are they 21? - And I'm nabbing a girl for Pauly, so, you know, let's go! Hell, yeah, I got this.

I'm not that girl from Jersey.
I'm giving you trust that you wouldn't bring back a girl or, like, hurt me.
Ron and Sam are back together.
This is the first time I've seen you smile in a long time.
- With Sam, I feel like this time is gonna be different.
No fighting this time, so - Oh, dear.
And let games begin.
- It'd be better if I was there.
- Yeah, it'd be way better if you were here.
- Ron has been calling this girl Hannah.
I don't know if Sam knows about this other chick, but she will flip out.
- I didn't want to say anything, 'cause he was drunk, but Ronnie was so funny last night.
He's like, "I got, like, five girls coming to the house right now.

- Yo, look at me.
You okay? You all right? Look at me.
I'm not even playing.
Just look at me.
Mike bashed his head into the wall.
And I could tell Mike is completely disoriented.
He's opening his eyes to me, but he's giving me a blank look.
This isn't funny anymore.
You okay? Get the [Bleep] Out of here.
What did I do to you? - [Mockingly] "What did I do?" Why don't you just tell me? What the []- - What did I do? - You didn't tell me that he told you that I was gonna bring home five girls the first [Bleep] Night.
- 'Cause anybody- they were [Bleep] There.
- Now he's a big man.
Now he's [Bleep] Laying on the floor.
Admit it, bro.
Admit your [Bleep] For once.
- Admit it? Admit it? - Admit it.
- Admit it.
I don't do nothing with your relationship, tough guy.
Let's do it! - Stop it! Let's do it! Stop! [Whimpers] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop it! Stop! - [Grunts] I'm bleeding.
I'm bleeding.
Stop it! Stop! Stop! - I waited for a long time to [Bleep] You up.
I waited for a long time to I've been waiting, bro.
I've been waiting for a long time to [Bleep] You up.
You did this for no reason, no reason at all No reason No reason.
He didn't hurt me.
There is not one little scrap on my face- nothing on my pretty face.
All those muscles didn't do [Bleep] To me.
Those [Bleep] Walls are [Bleep] Hard right there.
- How'd your knee in your [Bleep] Face feel? Yo, [Bleep] You, Ron! I'll take you on every day, mother[Bleep]! All you do is suck [Bleep], you [Bleep].
- I'll [Bleep] You up every day! - Get out of here.

Yo, [] You, you punk! - How's your face feel, you [Bleep] [Bleep].
- No matter what he said, it didn't matter to me.
Stop talking to me! - Ron! - Shut the [Bleep] Up! Stop talking to me! - Sam, walk away.
- Sam, please - Please just walk away.
- PleaseDon't Let's not make this Jersey.
- This isn't.
Just stop yelling at me! - Walk away from it! - Stop yelling at me! - This isn't [Bleep] Fun anymore! - Then stop [Bleep] Yelling at me! I [Bleep] Get it! - You need to walk away and leave this guy alone, because you're the reason why he's getting so amped up.
- I would love to- - stop! - Get out, then! - Stop it! - Sammi's still there.
- Just stop! - [Laughing] What? - Stop talking to me! - Stop.
Just stop.
- You're not worth nothing.
- Really? - I've been calling girls since I've been here.
- You've been calling girls since you've been here? - Yeah, every night.
- You ain't [Bleep].
Get out of my [Bleep] Face.
Get out of my face.
Thank you.
Finally.
Finally.
- Your boy's been waiting to do that for so long.
- Who-Ron? - [Laughing] Yeah.
But to be honest with you, he didn't do [Bleep], really.
I don't think either of them can fight.
I mean, I know Mike used to take karate, and Ronnie's got big muscles or whatever, but big muscles doesn't mean you can fight.
You need to know how to punch.
Neither of them know how to punch.
Like, Ronnie punched Mike.
It didn't do anything.
Mike knocked himself out.
I think Mike tried to commit suicide by hitting his head against the wall, 'cause he was sick of dealing with the Ron and Sam bull[Bleep].
Are you okay? You need to go to the hospital? - I don't want to.
You should.
- I don't want to go to the hospital.
Dude, [Bleep] Your pride.
You should feel better.
Make sure you know what's going on.
- I hit my head against a concrete wall.
It hurts.
- I understand.
So go to the hospital and make sure you're not, like, severely hurt.
Mike? You need to go.
I'm like, "dude, like, I know that you don't want to feel "like a lowlife and you got your ass beat, "but you need to go to the hospital to make sure that you're [Bleep] Okay.
" - [Crying] Oh, he needs help.
I don't like this.
[Line trilling] - We call the ambulance because we're afraid that Mike might have a concussion or something worse.
[Rock music] - Mike, I'm here with you, bro.
It's pauly.
I'm here with you, bro.
This is too much.
[Sniffles] - if I can't be someone of consequence - [Sniffles] I don't want the [Bleep] Kid to die.
I don't want him dead.
[Siren] - I'm so mad that jenni's talking to Ron.
He needs to be by himself.
Get the [Bleep] Out! - Please- - tell her to get the [] Out.
- I'm [Bleep] Begging you for our house.
I know, but, please.
I'm real worried about Mike right now.
They're gonna keep him for four more hours - just to do the cat scan.
- Yo, how you doing? - Mike, I'm here with you, bro.
It's Pauly.
I'm here with you, bro.
This is not fun anymore.
- Get the [] Out of here, bro.
- You need to just tell me what happened.
- Oh, my God! - Please.
Ronnie, you're talking to me.
Come on.
- She shouldn't be in there.
He's wasted.
It's not gonna matter what she says to him.
I hate to say it.
- No, but you should be in there, right? - I'm so mad that jenni's talking to Ron, because I feel like I'm the only person who understands, like, why Ron is acting like this right now, and I don't think that anything anybody says is gonna calm him down.
He needs to be by himself.
- Get the [Bleep] Out! - Please- - tell her to get the [Bleep] Out! - I know.
I get it.
Just please- I'm [Bleep] Begging you for our house.
I know, but, please, just [Bleep] Give us a minute.
Just please! - I [Bleep] Up tonight.
Why can't you just accept it? Stop.
- Don't [] Do this to me anymore.
I'm sick of it.
I'm sick of you putting me in this position.
I didn't do [Bleep] To you! [Bleep]! Leave me the [Bleep] Alone! - [Sighs] - Leave me the [] Alone! - Right now I'm thinking, "how can I get through this?" I feel like there's been a lot of jealousy and animosity between me and Mike, and I just let it build up and build up and build up.
I can't believe I let myself get so angry.
The kid's in the hospital and [Bleep].
That's kind of [Bleep] Up.
Finally there was just so much built-up [Bleep] With him that I was just like - Yeah.
It was a lot of unfinished and unsaid- - it felt like that everyone just let him get away with so much stuff all the time.
- In Ron's defense, he and Mike had this animosity towards each other for so long that this fight was, like, long overdue.
- [Sniffles] The second she's back with me, look what happens.
[Sighs] [Bleep] My life, dude.
[Crying] I did my best.
Dude.
[Sniffles] I know.
- I just feel like there's no point to, like, fight each other, you know? The craziest thing is, is that, like, he's in the hospital, and, like, it wasn't even from the fight.
Like, he [Bleep] Knocked himself out into the wall.
What the [Bleep]? Yeah, people get concussions a lot.
It's not, like- - yeah.
- I used to get them all the time from cheerleading.
- Mm-hmm.
- I'd smack myself right on the ground and be, like - You sure you didn't get that when you blacked out drunk and fell? - Well, that happens, too.
[All laugh] - I'm real worried about Mike right now.
Nobody should be alone with this [Bleep] Going on.
He needs somebody there for him, and I'll be there for him.
[Velcro tearing] Yo, how you doing? - Good.
A little better now that they let me use the bathroom.
- No doubt, no doubt.
We're here now, so We're here.
[Velcro tearing] - [Voice breaking] Me and Sam- we can't be together.
I'm like, "it's not healthy right now.
" What happened tonight was not the right way in any way.
I feel like I owe everybody in the house an apology.
[Sobbing] - Like, I have you crying.
My room's a mess.
My roommate's in the hospital.
- [Crying] I didn't want that to happen.
Like, I didn't want my roommates fighting, and, like I just feel terrible.
[Sighs] - I'm gonna leave you alone.
Then you come out and talk to me when you're ready.
Yeah.
[Sniffles] - You let me know.
I'll be in the smush room, I guess.
- What's up? - I love you, bro.
- You all right? What? - I love you.
You know that, right? - Yeah, but I don't like when you act like that, my dude.
- I know.
- It's like, when you drink, you literally become, like, a hothead.
It's [Bleep] Scary.
It's not worth it.
Like So just, please, bro- that's all I ask, you know.
Just-we'll work on it together.
When he's dating Sam, he flips out, turns into another person, and then says he's sorry.
But that doesn't make it okay.
You got to fix the problem.
- I love you, dog.
You know that.
- Yeah, I love you, too, man.
- You get me, brother.
- If you ever need to talk, I'm-you know? [Dramatic music] - Obviously, us being together is toxic.
So maybe it's just best to just-you know? We have our issues.
It sucks, because I do love you so much.
And I do care about you - [Clears throat] More than I care about myself.
- Stop, like, with that.
- Can I just talk? I'm sorry for the [Bleep] That I did say to you tonight.
- Whatever.
It's all true, anyway.
- It is true.
I did call a girl while I was here.
Who? - Just some random girl that I just- - hook up with? - No.
- Who is it? - Just some girl.
- Look at me in the face.
- Just some girl - Who? - That I - No, no, no, tell me a name, please.
- Some girl that I met.
- From where-long island? Good-bye.
- Can-can you just sit? - Can you just- look at me.
I'm gonna tell you one thing.
- I'm being honest.
- It's okay.
Be honest all you want.
But I just don't want anything to do with you ever again in my entire life.
Sam.
Sam.
[Sighs] I'm through with Ron and the bull[Bleep] And the lies and whatever that he has to say to me, 'cause everything he says is complete bull[Bleep].
- Can we please just talk, Sam? - Just, please, get away from me, please.
I blew my own cover, but, you know, I'm kind of glad that it came out, in a way.
I feel like a weight's been lifted off my shoulder.
I just want to talk, Sam.
- I don't care anymore.
What do you want to say? Like, do you.
I don't care anymore.
I don't ever want to look at you ever again.
Just-I don't care anymore.
Just get the [Bleep] Away from me.
I cared enough.
Get the [Bleep] Away from me.
- Dude, that's enough of this [Bleep].
No peace of mind.
Don't live in this house with [Bleep] Tension.
I'm tired of dwelling on stuff and just letting it destroy my present, and it's destroying my future.
I think the best thing for me to do is just go home right now.
[Pensive music] - Put my roommate in the hospital because of some girl that's been playing with my mind.
- Ronnie feels like he's trapped in his own mind right now and doesn't know who he is.
And because of that, he's trying to flee.
I want your butt[Bleep].
- That's not necessary.
Stop.
- Jionni is very quiet about sexuality.
And me-I'm just like, bam, "let's [Bleep] Dirty talk.
" - Aryou D.
T.
F.
? - Hey! - Dude, what's up, bro? - I can't be here, dude.
Can't do it.
- Just sleep it off, dude.
- It's not about sleeping it off.
It's about - Go to bed, bro.
You're in Italy.
Come on, bro.
- It's about how we played games.
I have no peace of mind.
I've been here for a week.
- Okay, but that doesn't mean that you go home.
- It's about peace of mind, and I don't have it.
- You know how you get peace of mind? Going through [Bleep] Like this is how you get peace of mind.
If you go home, you're gonna be [Bleep] Miserable and depressed.
Ronnie feels like he's trapped in his own mind right now and doesn't know who he is.
And because of that, he's trying to flee.
- I put my [Bleep] Roommate in the hospital Yeah, well - Because of some girl that's been playing with my mind for [Bleep] He last three weeks, bro.
- So make it better.
Don't go home.
So that's how you're gonna go down, by doing that? - What else am I gonna do, bro? - There's a light at the end of the tunnel.
I swear to God.
I promise you.
- Maybe I just need to wait for a few days.
- Do you know what it's like not to know what is wrong or what's right? I've been throwing away the efforts I've made to leave this all behind don't feel sorry for me - I just sat there and just thought about some [Bleep].
Vinny's like the Dr.
Phil in the house.
He's young, but he definitely gives good advice, and I think that he's right.
Why would I give up so much? You know what I mean? There's a reason why I'm here.
- You are the reason I go on [Telephone ringing] - Hello? - Hello.
Um, can I speak with, uh, nooki or, uh, Sally-Jenny? Who is this? I call from fast flora.
Are you a florist? Yes.
- All this crazy [Bleep] Is going on.
You know, I got roommates in the hospital.
I got [Bleep] Fights.
I got psychological talks that I'm having with people.
- I don't understand what you say.
- And I got florists calling me, telling me that they deliveries of flowers for the girls.
It's the last thing I want to hear right now.
- I call this afternoon.
- Yes.
- Uh, to this number? - Si.
- Okay, but- - all right, grazie.
[Bleep].
Vin convinces me to stay, so I decide to put Mike's bed back in the spot so that when he does get out of the hospital, he a place to lay his head down.
As much as I hate the kid and I can't stand him and I think he's a sneaky [Bleep], it's just like, he did get hurt.
I'm not that mean of a person.
- Yo.
- What happened? - I only got to see him for two seconds.
I was in the waiting room the whole time.
And they had to do, like, cat scans and all that stuff.
- They would know if there was something serious, right? - He did the cat scan.
They said it's nothing.
He should be fine.
They just got to keep him for observation.
It's probably the whole day.
I waited, like, four hours with Mike.
They're gonna keep him for four more hours for observation, so I head back to the house, exhausted.
I'm beat, though.
- Yeah, I didn't sleep a wink, bro.
It's [Bleep] I've been doing [Bleep] All night.
I'm beat.
[Uplifting music] [Doorbell pulsing] [Beeps] - You all right? - Yeah, I'm all right.
Just a little head trauma, a little sprain, a little of this, little of that.
You know what I mean? - Got us all worried, bro.
- [Chuckles] The doctor's prognosis was a light concussion, also combined with a neck sprain as well.
That's not good, 'cause, man, for the next couple days, I can't G.
T.
L.
I'm upset, man.
[Groaning] [Dramatic music] You all right? [Grunts] - [Groans] I didn't mean that [Bleep].
You know that, right? So, you know? - The conflict between me and Ron-it's unsettled.
At any time, it could pop off.
I won't hesitate to fight him, and he won't hesitate to fight me, because nobody got the better of each other in round one.
[Groans] What's up, baby? Let's do it, baby.
Let's do it, baby! I don't even know what he was saying, but I know it was bad, just by his tone and the way he was looking at me.
- It doesn't mean anything.
He's being a douche bag.
I'll just knock him out.
- After last night's [Bleep], there were so many emotions, like, so many thoughts going through my head that I was just beating myself up.
[Mellow music] I feel like I've been in this house, surrounded by so many people all the time, that I haven't had time to collect my thoughts.
Today I feel like I need to get out and spend the day by myself.
I am remorseful today.
I realize I definitely want to change the fact that I keep everything bottled up till I finally just explode.
Things that I don't have control over I can't flip out about.
I have to just learn how to let it just roll off my shoulder.
So I get up this morning, and there's mine and Nicole's flowers from our boyfriends.
Finally.
It's, like, cute adorable roses from jionni, and it has a little bunny inside.
And I'm just like, "meh.
" [Chuckles] - Oh, you're back? - You know Mike's home, right? - No.
- Oh, yeah, he's home, sleeping.
How is he-okay? He suffered head trauma, and then he can't go out for a week or something.
I need to do laundry.
- I have to pick mine up.
- Did you want to come with us? We'll drop it off, pick it up, and go eat.
Now that we know that Mike had no serious problem and it was just, like, a blow to the head, our house is kind of back to normal, not that it's a good normal, you know what I mean? But, hey, if it wasn't [Bleep] Up, it wouldn't be our house, right? - Is Ron and Sam together, or is Ron and Sam not together? - I feel like they're together.
- I just honestly don't want to hear anything about any of it.
I don't either.
- One of our roommates just went to the hospital because of Ron and Sam.
We're tired of the arguments.
And at this point, like, enough is enough.
- Ronnie and Sam's relationship is a joke.
- Ron's like, "I'm done.
I'm done.
I'm done.
" Then he's trying to get back with her, and I'm just like It's so sickening.
What comes to mind when I think of Ronnie and Sam is, like, me throwing up [Vinny speaking Italian] Because I can't stand it anymore.
- Ciao.
Good.
How are you? Oh! - We see Ronnie sitting there by himself, and I'm curious to see, you know, what Ronnie has to say for himself today.
- I'm sorry for last night, brother.
I'd never do something like that with you, like That [Bleep] Was built up three years.
- Oh, yeah.
No, sure.
It's the first time we're talking to Ronnie since the incident.
And he's just, like, real apologetic and real sorry that [Bleep] Went down.
- I tried to talk to her last night, and she was like, "I'm done with you.
" - Oh, wait.
You guys are done? That's what she said.
She's like, "I'm done.
" Right? She's like, "go [Bleep] Yourself.
" - Yeah, but we've heard that before.
You end up making it funny.
No, she actually was, like, "you're the scum earth piece of [Bleep].
" - Why do you love this girl? - I know.
I have no idea.
- So why would you want to be with someone like that? - I was actually happy the last few days with her.
That was five minutes, and then she proved herself once again.
- She wanted to see how much you care about her by flipping out on someone else.
- You know that's the mind state she has right now.
She has the mind state that "Ronnie called a girl," so now she's gonna have to try to get the upper hand on me.
- You got to be an adult and walk away from the relationship.
I've done it how many times? "I'm done.
I'm done.
I'm done with Sam.
" I get a breather.
I catch myself.
And then I'm like, "I'm not done.
I love her.
" - You walk away.
- Exactly.
- Like, you really can't help who you love.
- I love you as a friend.
- Okay.
- But you [Bleep] Up, and that's it.
It scared him to see him on a stretcher, because I do care about him as a friend.
If you go to the club with that look, you know how many girls are gonna be like, "what happened, honey?" - [Laughs] I know.
We're trying to get Ronnie to push up on some girls in the club.
He's talking to one girl.
- I'm trying to get at you.
- But if Ron brings a girl home, Sammi's gonna flip out.
- Hi.
Is Nicole there? - Oh, hold on.
Snooki! - What are you doing? - Nothing.
Did you get your flowers? - I got them.
I love them.
I miss you.
I want to, like, hang out.
I want to see you.
I'm sexually frustrated.
Are you? I was until I had fun in the shower, and then I was like, "brr, bye.
" Ugh.
Don't say that.
You're gross.
- I'm not gross.
It's a way of life.
What else is going on? - Nothing.
I want your butt[Bleep].
- That's not necessary.
Stop.
- Jionni is a very, like, quiet person.
You have to be quiet about your emotions, about sexuality and stuff like that.
And me-I'm just like, bam, "let's [Bleep] Dirty talk.
I'm [Bleep] Horny.
" Are you d.
T.
F.
? - Hey! - I'm gonna, like, have an orgasm right now.
- All right, can we please slow down a little bit with this [Bleep]? - Okay.
Jionni gets upset.
He's like,,, [Deep voice] "Don't say that.
" [Normal voice] I'm like, "come on.
" Like, I just don't want to think.
I just want to be myself.
Love you.
- Love you, too.
- Tootles.
He's such a jerk.
[Rock music] - 'cause by the look in your eyes it's safe to say you're five, five years away I've had enough.
And if he wants to be like this, I'll go give back everything Ron has given me, including the stuff I got him.
So I put all my stuff on Ron's bed.
Some guy out there will appreciate me as a person and will really love me for who I am, and it's not Ron.
[Whispering] Mike.
[Normal voice] Are you okay? I felt like I caused the problem.
Like, I'm not a fan of you, Mike, but, you know, I just felt bad.
Like, I don't want to see a roommate go to the hospital.
I apologize for everything.
I'm sorry.
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you sure you're okay? - Mm-hmm.
I didn't really even listen to her apolwgy too much, because it is Sam's fault we fought.
And I just went through a wall.
I can't hear that [Bleep].
[Mellow music] [Groans] [Stove clicking] I have a big heart, you know.
And if somebody else was hurt in the house, like me, I would be checking on them.
But nobody was really checking on me, really, that much, you know what I mean? So I kind of felt alienated a little bit.
[Sniffles] I want [Sniffles] - What everybody else wants - [Sighs] [Crunches] I'm definitely feeling alone- definitely feeling alone right now.
A place to lay my head [Sniffles] [Doorbell pulsing] [Beeps] You have a neck brace on? You all right? When I see Mike in his neck brace, I feel like he's doing an insurance claim right now.
It was a mild concussion from the head butt to the wall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
- And that was it.
And some-you know, from when I hit my head- what was it, like, whiplash? - Yeah, like, in my neck.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's good it's not major.
We see Mike in a neck brace.
I'm like, "oh, my God.
" He's got his glasses on, like always, and a neck brace.
You don't wear sunglasses with a neck brace.
He looks ridiculous.
- They said I'll be out for, like, a week.
[Mellow rock music] Get the [Bleep] Out of here.
What are you doing? [Whispering] Who's is that? [Normal voice] Is that yours? What are you doing? Ronnie! Oh, God.
[Dramatic music] Yours? - Mm-hmm.
It's okay.
I figured.
I was a little immature by putting stuff on Ron's bed, but throwing out now stuff is a little bit going, you know, too far.
And the earrings- did you throw them out, too? I'll take them.
I don't do this.
- Shouldn't be throwing that out.
Diamond earrings- get out of here.
Whatever.
That [Bleep] Was cement.
The only reason I did that was because I was like, "I might as well the pain out the way now.
" What? I don't think I would've put you in the hospital.
The wall put you in the hospital.
- That [Bleep] Doesn't even have a dent on it.
- Che cosa? - What does that mean? Some guy was talking [Bleep] While I was dancing with this chick.
- Look.
Over there? - You ain't [Bleep], mother[Bleep]! - You're in the streets of Florence! Yeah, you're in the streets of Florence! Let's do it! - So we're leaving in ten minutes.
Don't leave without me, or I'll never talk to you guys again.
You all right? - I didn't realize that wall was so hard.
[Chuckling] I try to be the peacemaker in this house.
Even though me and him could fight at any instant, I still respect the kid.
- What the? - [Chuckling] Oh, no, 'cause [Chuckles] The only-the only reason I did that was because I had got into a fight, like, maybe, like, two years ago.
And this dude was, like, double your size, and I was like, "[Bleep].
I'm gonna have a problem.
" I was like, "I might as well get the paint out the way now.
" So I put my head through a sheetrock wall, and the kid was like, "holy [Bleep].
This kid's crazy.
" But I didn't know that [Bleep] Was cement.
That [Bleep] Doesn't even have a dent on it.
I- I knew I might've had a problem with you.
I was like, "all right" - [Laughing wildly] "Let's do this.
" - What? It didn't even make sense.
Like, I don't think I would've put you in the hospital.
The wall put you in the hospital.
- So, I mean, it is kind of funny now.
I don't get that.
They're laughing in there.
- Oh, Ron and Mike? - Yes.
Ron and Mike.
They resolved it.
I've been trying to stay out of the relationship with you and your girl, like, 3,000%.
And by any means, I didn't- definitely didn't mean to- to upset you like that, you know what I mean? And, uh, if, uh If us having to fight like that and me banging my head- I mean, 'cause that happened.
You know what I mean? Exactly.
- What are the boys doing tonight? - Who cares? - So it's girls' night? Yeah.
You look like a pilgrim.
Do the Italian look.
- Oh, it's so nice out tonight.
- We have to go to Tijuana for dinner.
I don't know about you, but I plan on frickin' drinking at this bar.
I'm living in the sun drinking up the fun I'm going all over town the town, baby - We should celebrate.
- Oh, yeah.
- This will be a fun night.
- I want to do this every night.
- We should.
- I will.
- I don't like hanging out with the guys.
We have us girls to have our backs, and, you know, the best times is with your girls.
I tell you that.
It's the truth.
- Well, this is a turn of events from the [Bleep] Scary place.
If mikor anyone says [Bleep] Like that to you, say it that moment or day, or let it go.
- And don't fight.
Just be like, "did you say this?" - Yes.
And don't, like, kind of- 'cause it looks like you're using it as ammo for the future.
I have to rk on myself.
I actually feel like really bad for my roommates that they're part of our fighting.
Like, it makes me sick.
I didn't want to come into Italy and do that.
And I think that the girls are trying to give me good advice, like girlfriends would do.
- So is Mike going out tonight, or is he staying in? - He can't take the neck brace off for a week.
He can't go out for a week.
- He can't go out? - Oh, no.
- I didn't know that.
- Really? - I didn't know that either.
- Sorry.
You guys ready? - Let's do this.
- All right, let's go.
R.
V.
P.
It's r.
V.
P.
Right now.
Mike's home still dealing with his issues and trying to find a way to apologize to the wall, I guess.
[Electronic music] - Yeah, buddy.
Yeah, buddy.
Yeah, buddy.
Is this it? Everything is all right everything is all right seaside moonlight take a break, form a line Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh! Hey! Hey! Hey! Everything is all right I saw this pixie on a fixy out in front of the bar - I'm gonna go get a drink.
- This guy's wasted right now.
- What do you want to drink? - Mojito.
- It's finally starting to feel like I'm out with single Ronnie.
I got it.
I got it.
- He's got that look on his face like he's gonna creep.
I'm like, "damn, I hope he starts hooking up.
" - I'm from New York, okay? - Okay.
- I'm from New York.
- I know.
But, babe, I'm your girl.
- You're cool as [Bleep].
Che cosa? Look.
Over there? - Che cosa? - What does that mean? Che cosa? Some guy was talking [Bleep] While I was dancing with this chick.
[Girl speaking Italian] Che cosa? - Do it.
What's up, baby? What's up, baby? Let's do it, baby.
Let's do it, baby! I don't even know what the [Bleep] He was saying, but I know it was bad, just by his tone and the way he was looking at me.
- It doesn't mean anything.
He's being a douche bag.
I'll just knock him out.
He's being a douche bag.
- Aah! What's up, baby? What's up, baby? What's up, baby? Let's do it, baby! I'll [] You up! What's up, baby? What's up, baby? You ain't [Bleep], mother[Bleep]! - You're in the streets of Florence! Yeah, you're in the streets of Florence! - Let's do it, baby! Let's do it, then! Let's do it! - Yo, what's up? - You ain't [Bleep], mother[Bleep]! - You're in the streets of Florence! Yeah, you're in the streets of Florence! - Let's do it, baby! - Let's fight! - Let's do it, then! - Yeah! Yo, what's up? - Get back.
- Who is that? - Yo, some gorilla talked [Bleep].
Pauly was white boy wasted.
At any other time, Pauly wouldn't have even reacted to that.
But mixing pauly's state of mind with these guys being ass[Bleep], it made pauly snap.
These guys have been starting with everybody all night- these two guys.
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.
I'm too happy to be mad.
I held back, and I kept my cool.
I don't want to fight.
I'm not a fighter.
- Let's go over there for a little bit.
- I think he was jealous I was dancing with that girl.
Maybe it was his girlfriend.
That's probably why.
[Rock music] [Deena counting in Italian] [Snooki and deena shouting in Italian] - Who wants to get naked and get spray-tanned? - Actually, I've been naked this entire [Bleep] Trip.
You okay? I kind of wanted to talk to you.
Okay.
- Are you sad? You sad? I just want to say, the b.
S.
That went on- I'm still mad at you for that.
You're a [Bleep] For that.
But the fact that I saw you on the floor.
God forbid anything happened to you, and that was the last words I said to you- I want you to know I love you as a friend.
- Okay.
- But you [Bleep] Up.
And that's it.
You know? - Okay.
- I saw you on the stretcher.
I started crying.
Like, it's not okay.
I thought you were dying.
- [Laughs] - Ass[Bleep].
- I hit a concrete wall pretty hard.
- Okay, well, I thought you were dying-I don't know.
- Me and snooks- she was a little mad at me.
I was a little mad at her.
And after a trip to the hospital, we realized that at the end of the day, we love each other.
So I don't think Nicole and jionni are meant for each other.
- If you go to the club with that look, you know how many girls are gonna be like, "what happened, honey?" - [Laughs] I know.
- Dude, you'll get mad girls with that [Bleep].
La la la la la la la na na na [Shouts in Italian] - Girl, I've been all over the world looking for you No, we need a drink! - I'm known for taking what I think I deserve and you're overdue She likes you.
We're trying to get Ronnie to push up on some girls in the club.
He's talking to one girl, but you can tell that he's scared because of Sammi.
I'm trying to get at you.
- If Ron brings a girl home, Sammi's gonna flip out, 'cause that'll just start another war.
But a man has needs.
What, is he gonna wait two months to do it? I don't think so.
Na na na na na - You okay? Listen, let's get out of here.
You okay? I meet a girl.
Then I realize that, you know, I don't want these grenades, these things that Vinny and pauly bring home.
Scusi.
Sorry.
The old Ronnie in Miami would've brought a girl back just to get a rise out of Sam.
How much? Sam always expects the worst out of me, especially when she's not there to watch over me.
I'm not that dumb.
Come on.
I'll give you ten.
Instead of bringing home a grenade girl to get her mad and start another fight, let me be an adult and show her, "you're the ass[Bleep].
And I'm not the ass[Bleep] Anymore.
" - Oh, there we go.
We got it.
[Upbeat electronic music] - You let her.
I'm gonna [Bleep] You tonight, Ronnie.
[Vinny laughing] - [Bleep] Tonight.
- Whoo! - I don't know what to do with myself.
What if Ron brings home a girl? I don't know if I can handle this right now.
- Yo.
[Chuckles] [Speaking gibberish] - I don't like feeling like this.
Where's my ex-girlfriend? I'm the ass[Bleep].
All right? Just so you know.
Just so you know.
That's all I got to say.
- Are those for somebody else? Just so you know.
So I give Sam the flowers, just kind of showing her I'm gonna be happy either way, like, you know what I mean? Like, I'm gonna move on, like, you know what I mean? Whether it's with or without you at this point, like, you know? - Did you bring home another girl? - Are you kidding? - Yeah, absolutely.
I brought home [Bleep] Mad girls.
[Chuckles] When I give you flowers, don't ask me if I brought home a girl.
- The biggest piece of [Bleep] Ever - Ron, I'm just trying to talk to you, like, normally.
- That comes home with flowers for his ex-girlfriend.
I wish I had a piece of shit like that.
Ah.
He got me flowers.
Like, I'm, like, more than confused right now.
Hello.
Yeah, what's up? - Why are you being mean to me? Every time I try talking to you, you're, like, ignoring me.
Why would you get me flowers if you want to ignore me? Like, thank you.
I'm trying to say thank you, and you just won't even, like, let me.
- Great way of showing thank you.
[Grunts] - Every time I try to, like, talk to you- - so you know what? Find somebody better than me.
Call me in [Bleep] Four years when you find somebody better than me.
- Oh, you're so [Scoffs] - Yeah, whatever.
You too.
You tell somebody to go [Bleep] Themselves.
"You're a piece of [Bleep].
You're a scumbag.
" And see if they come home with a [Bleep] Dozen roses for you - Can you just sit here? - And see how it goes.
What did I just do? Like, why did I even get her the roses? Whatever, dude.
- Thank you for the flowers.
I'm taking them back.
Ever since it started girl, I always knew Waste of my [Bleep] Money and mybleep] Time, bro.
[Bleep].
You don't deserve me, and you don't deserve these roses.
Tell me you love me that's all I need to hear then I'll have no need to stay, and I can disappear - Okay, you just bought me flowers, and now you're throwing them out, so now I'm like, "what the [Bleep]?" In my head.
Like, what is going on? It hurts.
I'm just all-like, I feel all [Bleep] Up in the head at this point.

All he said was, "well, I don't think I'm gonna come now.
" And he's like, "I can't deal with this right now," and he got off the phone.
I know he wants to come.
He's just saying- - he's being a drama queen.
He's being dramatic.
- Go away this weekend with us.
Let him breathe.
- I just don't get it.
Whatever.
All right, girls, get ready to pack.
- I have too much stuff to bring.
- Don't forget a bathing suit.
- I wanna wear a speedo.
- Are you doing casual or cute? - Cute.
Dress up.
- An Italian beach.
Does that mean nudity? - Does that mean ding-dongs hanging out? - I figure lunch, dinner, club, beach, so You can't be a girl and know exactly what you wanna wear.
You need options.
I bring six bathing suits, six club clothes, four or five day clothes.
Better to be over-packed than under.
Did you bring underwears? - Look at these.
- Are those period underwear? - I brought so many bathing suits, like, 'cause if there's a beach out here.
We gotta get out of here.

Mike packed like he's going to Miami for three weeks.

- Oh,.
- Don't scratch my fiat.
Y'all, am I throwing this up there? - Hold up, hold up, hold up.
That's not gonna work.
- How many guidos does it take to put luggage on the car? - Honestly, how come you've got so many bags? We're going to a beach for 24 hours, where you're not gonna need clothes, and you have no shirt on with flip-flops.
So there's no reason to have so much luggage on those little fiats.
What the fiat? Oh, my God, this is tight.
Ugh! My foot! - Roll out, boys.
- I wonder if there are shops where we can buy clothes.
- Deena's is out.

See? Err.
- Ooh! Can I have this one? Okay.
I just spent $400 on hello kitty.
- Venti quattro, i think, is five.
- Wish you were a lesbian! Weirdo.
- You're a weirdo.
- Stop.
Nicole and Deena are on a whole 'nother level of drunk right now.
- Oh, my drink! Oh, sorry.
- And me and Sam are kind of sick of it at this point.
Like, give me a break.
Deena, we're leaving! - Sam, Jen! Wait! - Wait, mommies.
I like that fricken hot hot bikini.
Hot pink.
- You're gonna get it tonight really hard.
- Man-whore! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! - Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! - That's how vinny says it.
- Sammi! - They're creeping me out.
- Jenni, your cheeks are out.
- Get it, Jen! - Are they mad at us? - A little bit.
What're you gonna do? - Why? - 'Cause we're drunk and stupid.
- I don't wanna be taking care of two drunk people.
Like, I actually wanted Riccione to be fun.
Yay! - They're drunk.
Come on.
I don't- I just wanna go back.
Please.
Me and Sam realize we don't wanna continue drinking.
Deena and Nicole want to, so I think it's time that we separate.
- Oh, God, I'm freezing.
- I'm annoyed too right now.
- Where's Sam and jenni? They can't leave us.
- This is our door, I think.
- What moms leave their kids? - I hear house music.
What the is over there? - Let's go.
Can we go? - Do you hear it? It feels like heaven, like the gods have spoke, and we hear music.
- Oh, my God! - Don't run! Don't run! I'm gonna fall.
I'm not kidding! Deena, you! Jenni and Sam are, like, running back to the hotel.
So they can go back to the hotel, and me and Deena can go to heaven and dance our asses off.
- Bravo! - Yay! Bravo! - All right, come here.
I'm definitely happy just being alone with Deena right now.
I mean, we have the same personality.
We like to drink, we like to party, and it's just team meatballs.
Let's have some more champagne and sit down-! - Oh! - Oh, my God! I'll beat you in the ass.
Don't do that! Then all of a sudden we see the boys, and we're like, "why are the boys so dressed up?" - You guys gotta go home and shower.
We're going to dinner at 9:30.
- What time is it? - It's 7:40.
- Oh, it's early! We'll be fine.
- All right, that's what's up.
All the guys are just watching team meatball just get drunker and drunker.
- Wow, Deena's wasted! - She pulled her out and everything.
- Right now Snooki and Deena are whacked off their face.
We're thinking there's no way they can make it to dinner or even out to a club to do this again tonight.
- Aah! - Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
Snooki just ran into the bush face first.
- I couldn't stop, I couldn't stop.
I couldn't stop, you bitch! - Oh, my God! How did she do that? - Holy! - She has no underwear on! Deena is showing her cuca to the whole entire club.
Go and take a look at your face - Holy! - I couldn't stop! I couldn't stop, you bitch! Team meatballs can handle anything when it comes to alcohol, so we're gonna go mad hard all day and then mad hard at the club.
- I took a hot shower.
How about you? - I feel amazing.
- Yeah.
- I wonder what those two are gonna look like.
- Oh, my God.
I don't wanna know.
I thought Nicole was the only person on this planet that has those abducted eyes, until Deena recently.
- Yeah.
- They are two of a kind.
- It's so weird.
They are kind of alike.
- So similar it's creepy.
- Yo, she's on the floor doing the cat.
The guys right now, we don't think the meatballs are gonna make it to dinner tonight.
Snooki and Deena are the meatballs, and they're not making it to the sauce.
- Deena's is out.
- Oh, yeah! - Oh, the panties! - Yo, I never danced my underwear off in my life! She goes hard.
I give her credit.
- It's only, like, Jersey girls that can dance so hard their underwears come off.
Who the hell does like this? - There's gotta be another place we can go to.
- Let's just walk around.
Snooki and Deena are just out of control right now.
The guys actually were like, "look, let's just go outside.
We gotta get out.
" - Holy .
One more shot and she's blacked out.
- This is it.
- Look at this lobster! Holy! These are dinosaurs.
- Saw a picture of the sea today - Deena and Nicole have the same abducted luck.
- We said this when we left.
We were like, "they're gonna be abducted.
We don't wanna deal with it.
" - Going back spells disaster, you know - What time is it? - We have to go home, and get changed, and like, be cute, you know? Let's go.
- All right.
- Where are my meatballs? - We watched them get drunk for two hours straight.
I watched Snooki run straight first into a bush, like how Mike ran into the wall.
- I just want them all to be here for dinner, and we can all go to the club on time.
- I can't wait to get to the discotheque.
- Can't wait to dance.
- I came to dance.
- We're ready to order.
- I don't even know what's on the menu, but I'm ready to order.
- Uh-oh.
I pissed on myself.
- What is that? - Fish of the day, bro.
- The girls are nowhere to be found, and we're starving.
We gotta eat, and we're just not having meatballs for dinner tonight.
T's get dessert.
- I think I wanna go out.
- Know what everyone's gonna say? "You're drinking too much," mur, mur, mur.
- 100, 200, 300? - Hello.
I'm over it, all right? - What is that? - You all right? - Um, vodka - And you didn't bring me none? - We just had, like, a six-course meal, and now the meatballs show up to get their dinner.
- Whoo! - Oh, I can't yell.
- Oh, God, I myself.
- Snooki and Deena, they knew for hours what time dinner was, for hours what time we were going for the club.
- I thought we- I thought we-whoa.
- Huh? I want your peppers, actually.
- And we're still waiting on them.
- Stick with me and we'll be fine.
- Uh-huh, yeah.
Me and you have to stay together.
- If we both get crazy, it's not a big deal.
- Uh-huh.
- You ready? - Disco pop off! - Toodles! - Grazie.
Ciao.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
- As he's itching.
What the hell? Wow.
Happy you made it here.
Discotheque.
- Yeah - See! - Dee, maybe you should go out and stay home.
- No, I don't want- need to stay home.
- Like, what the is going on? Like, it's like a twilight zone.
And I'm thinking in my head, "this is gonna be a miserable time now, "because now I'm gonna have to take care of my friend who can barely even, like, sit up in the car.
" - I'm disgusting 'cause I'm- - you smell that? - Oh.
- Like, oh, my God.
I'm, like, I really miss you Everything- - this sounds like the cab ride home.
- I know.
- Not to the club.
This sounds like the one on the way back- - well, we're already up, so - We're not even at the club.
- What are you gonna do? Whatever.
- Tonight's gonna be one of those nights.
I already know.
- Just.
- I have no shame.
Can't wait.
- Yeah, boy! Gotta love Italy this time of year! The club scene in Riccione is pretty sick, and, you know, it's just jumpin', a good time, parties on the beach.
Sounds a little familiar, what we're used to in Jersey.
Oh, yo! - Oh! - I love this.
- I see underwear.
- Honestly, jenni gets really annoying to me, just because she's like my mom.
T/ and I'm like, "shut up.
" - I'm tired of being a mom.
I'm gonna be a mom in a couple years.
- You're the perfect role for everyone.
- Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I love Italy this time of year! - She has no underwearn! - Whatever.
I forgot to put underwears on.
- Deena! Deena! You have no underwear on! - No one sees it! - Deena is showing her cuca to the whole entire club.
- I saw your vagina.
- Whatever.
- It's bad enough if a nipple slips at a club, but you never are supposed to forget your underwear.
That is blech.
All I know is Deena needs a wax.
- Whoo! - What the hell? - What the is going on? Because Nicole's all about jionni.
And, Deena, are you lesbian? All I see in the reflection of this glass is straight vagine, straight vagina.
- I saw your vagina reflecting on the window! I tell Deena right away, like, "listen.
You are giving everyone a free show.
Put it away.
" And Deena's like, "get off of me.
" And I'm like, "dude, your vagina's out!" Hey, where are you going? - We're wandering.
- It's crunk.
- Damn! - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God, they're crazy.
They're crazy.
What the is going on? Because Nicole is all about jionni.
And, Deena, like, are you lesbian? - What the Nicole and Deena are digesting each other's tongues.
I am so skeeved out.
Like, I want to throw up.
- What the hell? Let's be honest here! - Does that turn you on? - No! - Deena is on top of Nicole, and she's not wearing underwear.
- Oh, my God.
Wow.
- What is happening? - I love making out.
I'm the best kisser, I think, in this whole planet.
Or on this whole planet.
On this whole planet.
- Oh, it's so awkward! Then I'm like, "all right, time to go home.
" - Let's go.
- - Party's over.
- God.
- Deena! Ow! - I'm up.
Hey, Deena, stop making a scene, and "les" go! - Come on.
Cool.
- Why do I always have to be the mom? - Come on! I love you.
- There goes my night.
- Wanna make out? - Okay.
- They've been making out for, like, three hours.
- This isn't an ordinary girl make-out session.
This is, like, they are going to each other when they get back to the hotel, and I have to share a room with them.
- I don't even make out this long with Ron.
- Oh, thank God, we're home.
- Oh, God, get me the out of this make-out session.
- You're, like-you guys are , like, lame.
- Oh, shut up.
- Let's go home.
Me and you are sleeping on the couch.
- They literally were making out the whole ride home.
When we got home, they were still making out.
I felt like I was watching a porn for, like, 20 hours.
- I'm going to bed.
- Como se dice pop? Good night.
- You're such a pervert.
- Oh, yeah! We're in Riccione, y'all! Wake up! - I get woken up kind of disturbingly.
Um, Ronnie swacked my wakeup call.
- We're in Riccione.
Yeah.
- We all got our own swagger.
Everything you say, do, wear is your swagg.
So "swacking" is swacked- like, if you get swacked, you get swagger-jacked.
- Let's roll.
- Whatever I do, or say, or wear, Ronnie does the same exact thing.
Busted big time again.
- Busted big time again, huh? - Ciao! Ciao, ciao, ciao, ciao - I mean, sometimes the stuff I do is contagious, so I understand, but damn, I was surprised he didn't come to Italy with a blowout.
That's all I'm saying.
Mike, who woke you up this morning? - Ronnie.
- Oh, yeah.
Wake up, yeah.
- Swacking.
I think he's just trying to find himself.
One day it's situation, and one day it's pauly d.
- Just come up with your own , bro.
Be original, son.
- I'm gonna put it on the record right now that I am not a swacker.
Pauly, I ain't trying to Jack your swagg, my dude.
Yeah, buddy.
- I wake up in Riccione, and Deena and Nicole is passed out.
And me and Sammi, we wanna go shopping together and enjoy the rest of our day in Riccione before we have to pack our crap and leave.
I flipped last night.
I, like, screamed at them to stop.
- Stop making out? - Yeah.
I wish I had the men in black zapper to undo the whole night, because I cannot physically, emotionally, economically, mentally accept the fact that Deena and Nicole just, like, hooked up like that.
- And they're like, "well, I'm sexually frustrated, "and you're sexually frustrated, so why don't we just do it?" - Dude, didn't Deena say- she was, like, uh, "I had my bi experience, and now I'm done with it," and all that? - But snooks went at it, and Deena, Deena was so down.
- It's, like, embarrassing to us while it was going down in the club.
I'm on jionni's side right now.
Now I can see why he gives her attitude when she gets drunk.
Cheating is cheating is cheating is cheating.
It's whether with a dude, a girl, whatever they're into, it's still, like, crossing that line.
- Do you think jionni cares if she hooks up with girls? - Yeah.
Bro, the way that went down! - Yo, that 's over.
If Nicole told me that she hooked up with another girl, I would definitely break up with Nicole.
- He's so worried about what she's doing behind his back anyway.
- He's gonna leave her ass.
- I'm gonna call jionni.
I have something to tell you.
- What? - But you can't be mad.
- Jionni might break up with her over this, and if that happens, I know Nicole will go home because of this.
- I might wanna get, like, a little souvenir.
- This is python? I don't like snakes.
Ciao.
Grazie.
- Now what? Oh, those are cute.
- Ronnie, you gotta try these on.
Yeah, that's a good look for you, bro! - Wow.
I love it here.
Can we stay one more day? - What the hell? The girls are still sleeping.
- No way.
- It smells like hot sweat and regret in here.
- We're leaving soon, guys.
- I don't feel good.
- So I wake up, and my are out, Deena's spooning me, and I'm just like, "what the hell?" Holy! - You look like death! - I need food.
- Didn't eat enough last night? Oh! - That's gross.
- I don't even know what that means.
- Regrets.
We got plenty of pop in the fridge.
Oh! - Dude, what the happened last night? - I don't know.
- All I know is- - I don't remember a thing.
- I don't remember anything after we left that restaurant.
- I don't- I don't remember the club.
Do you remember the club? - I don't remember the club at all.
I don't remember anything.
- I remember making out with you.
- We didn't do anything else.
They're saying that we, like, hooked up, but I don't think so.
- I don't think so either.
- I don't know.
When you do sex- usually, even if I'm blacked out, I know I did sex.
- The only time I put you in check, to check your vagina.
- Her vagine was out all night, like, straight-up out.
- Like, legit vagina? - Like, her-she went like this.
There was a clear wall, and Deena goes like this, grabs the wall, goes like this, buh, like this.
- Yeah, like that.
- And the people- - and the whole crowd.
- The whole crowd are like- - you guys are two of a kind, let me tell ya.
- You guys were making out for, like, hours.
Hours.
- But it was like - I feel like that's how we would-.
- Ew, stop, jerk.
- It was passionate.
Okay, Deena was on there, and you were like this-ugh! I'm not even kidding you.
- Samantha! - And I'm like, okay - My-what's- what did I do last night? - You were lying right next to us, right? There were knees up at one point, but I- - what do you mean "knees up"? - This is what I saw.
It was a little weird, and I'm like- - do you think jionni's gonna be mad? - Yeah.
- No, he's not.
- Hey, if he's not gonna be mad, then you have nothing to worry about.
- Checking out, room 406.
- Hook that to that left corner.
- Yeah, there we go.
- Ain't going anywhere.
- Ciao! - Smells like burning rubber, doesn't it? - I feel like it's our car.
All right, this doesn't even sound right.
- What the hell is that smell? It's horrible.
- We're smoking.
We gotta pull over.
We're smokin'.
- I drive a fricken fiat.
They can't keep up with a fiat.
- The fricken park brake's on! - Oh, my God.
She's burning up the- - my bad.
We made it! - The guidos qre back, the guidos are back.
- Oh, I'm gonna call jionni.
- Dun, dun, dun - Yo! Everybody quiet! I wanna hear this phone call! Can you put it on speaker? - Do you got any popcorn? Ooh.
- Hello? - Hey.
- Hi.
- Shh, shh, shh.
Trying to hear the confession.
- Are you done being mad at me? - I'm not mad at you.
- You were when I left.
- No, I wasn't.
- Yeah.
- How was your trip? - It was awesome! - So did you do anything bad? - Well I have something to tell you.
- What? - But you can't be mad.
- Here it comes, here it comes.
- I feel like you're gonna be mad.
- All right, what? - Jionni might break up with her over this, and if that happens, I might as well help Nicole pack, 'cause I know Nicole will go home because of this.
- So me and Deena got really drunk, and, um - What? What? - Oh, dear.
- Slow down.
- Oh, my God! - We hit the cop.
- Me! - They're getting out stretchers? Really? - Shut up! - I have something to tell you.
But you can't be mad.
- All right, what? - So me and Deena got really drunk, and, you know, we just ended up, like, doing stuff.
- What? - Like making out and, um, that's it, pretty much, but, like, it was intense, you know? - So that's all you did, was make out with Deena? - Yeah.
- All right.
Okay.
- But finally he's like, "okay.
" Like, awkward, but everything's fine.
- All right, well, as long as you know you were good, and that's it.
I don't know what else I can say.
- Okay, I love you.
- I love you too.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Ugh, I'm sweating.
- Good night.
Have fun.
- Ciao.
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
- No, there's a girl and a guy in that room.
- Snooks, we gotta go.
Deena! We gotta go! - We had a crazy weekend.
I drank for a legit, like, 24 hours straight, and I feel like my body's still recovering from it.
So for me to wake up and go to the pizzeria at this stupid hour, I'm not that thrilled.
Buongiorno.
- Buongiorno.
Como esta? - Morning.
- Ciao.
Smile.
- I'm not a morning person.
- Ciao.
- So beware.
- It's a dog.
Oh, no, that's your shoes, sorry.
- Do you like them? I wore them for you.
- Too much hair.
We need to restock refrigerator.
You remember downstairs, okay? - I got ya.
- I've never seen Mike work so hard in my life.
I'm surprised with Mike.
I mean, usually he's like, "I'm not gonna work," and he legit doesn't work.
He just stands outside and talks to people.
So the fact that Mike's, like, bringing up waters, and stocking all the fridges and stuff, I mean, I'm kind of impressed.
- Come se dice "job" in italiano? - Lavoro.
- Lav-"r," "r," "r.
" "Lavoyo.
" - Lavoro.
- "Valoyo.
" It's been about a week since I've been to work, and I feel fresh, I feel great.
It's a brand-new me, and, you know, I'm working hard today.
Nemo, the master pizza maker.
Nemo no like me? I'm too pretty.
- Let's hide.
- Hide where? - I don't know.
He was actually working.
Me and Nicole were like, mur, like, we don't wanna be here.
I have a great idea.
- Yeah? - Shh! - Ow! My knee! - Wait.
- He'll never find us now.
- I feel like there used to be garbage in here.
- Doesn't smell like garbage.
- It doesn't smell like garbage.
- Buona pizza, buona pizza! - How do you just, like, maneuver this? - I don't know how I'm gonna get out.
Ow! You! - Ow! You scraped me! - Deena, Nicole! - Oh,.
- Don't say anything.
Don't say anything.
- Sorry, I need your help downstairs.
- Buzz kill! - Big time, yeah! - Officially hate morning shift.
- Whatever.
- Thank you.
- What are you gonna do? - Which way, right? Ugh.
- So work's over, and we're like, "oh, you know what? Let's get back into fricken, like, the whole routine.
Like, let's go to the gym, let's work out.
- Ugh, there's, like, traffic.
Well, what are you gonna do? Watch out,.
Come on! The scooters are like bees.
They don't give a if they get run over.
I feel like Italy shouldn't even have cars, 'cause first off, nobody knows how to drive here.
I was always scared to drive in the city.
Now? Yeah, right.
- Now you can fricken take people out.
- Yeah, I'll kill taxis.
It's just, like, chaos.
It's like, people are walking in the streets.
You have to drive in New York City times ten.
- I'm just gonna use my hands.
Clearly nobody else, like, looks at blinkers.
Go.
Move.
God, these people are insane.
- You.
- Wait one second.
- They don't look.
They just go.
- Whoa! Oh, my God.
Slow down.
- Oh, my God! - We hit the cop.
- Me! - These people are insane.
Oh, my God! - Me! - - We hit the cop.
Oh, my God, are we gonna get in trouble? - Probably! - What the! Up my life! Hi, sir.
- Driving license - I know.
It's in my- - car documents, and insurance.
- It's not with me.
I have to go home to get it.
So how does this work here? Do you get arrested if you don't have a license? - I don't know.
I'm just scared that I'm gonna go to jail again.
I can't call the boys right now, because I'll start crying.
I need Deena to call them, ask them, you know, you need to bring, you know, Nicole's license here, or she's gonna get taken away by the cops.
- Hello? - Vin? It's Deena.
- What do you want? - We just got into a car accident.
Me and Nicole, we hit the cop.
But Nicole needs her license.
Look for Nicole's purse.
It's black.
- All right, what street are you on? It was very, very serious, you know.
We're running out the door right now.
I got it, I got it.
We don't know the magnitude of the situation, but we know we gotta get there quick.
- Where did she say she was? - Just some weird street.
Filippo strozzi.
- My life.
- I can't breathe.
Ugh.
I'm gonna get right now.
- Go.
Go.
Come on! - They're getting out stretchers? Really? - Shut up! He's putting a neck brace on.
I feel sick.
- Come on! - Yo, we gotta get there fast, though.
We gotta get there right now.
- I'm.
- I'm not kidding.
- Test for alcohol.
- Like, give me a break.
- Okay.
- Oh, , I'm dizzy.
What are they doing now? - Let's go.
- Don't do this.
Please! - Let's go.
- No! I don't wanna go in the back of a cop car ever again.
- Oh, my God.
- Please! Please.
I don't wanna go there.
This sucks! - Keep going, keep going, keep going, come on, come on.
- Nicole is locked up.
They might kick us out of Italy.
- My life.
- Come on, come on.
She's in the car.
- Are you here, or is this a joke? Oh, my goooodness! Me and Jionni, we're gonna have guido babies.
I know it.
I can't wait to pop those suckers out.
Let's go in the floor show.
- We hear the doorbell ring.
- It's Brittany! Let me in! - I bring her in and put her in Mike's bed, so when Mike comes home with a chick, he's.
- No way.
Wow! - Ugh, this is gonna be tough to get out of.
- You're dancing like a whore.
- What happened? - She's embarrassing me.
- Jionni! Where's my boyfriend? - You're acting like a.
- Where's he going, jenni? - He's running away from you! I don't deserve this right now.
Breaks my heart.
My heart's broken right now.
[Sobbing] My girlfriend was dancing like a [Bleep] pig in front of me.
What do you want me to do? A pig? I need a break from you.
I don't want to talk to you.
Excuse me? I'm sorry.
I don't want to talk to you.
I would take care of you like you've never been taken care of before.
I love you.
I do.
I'm laying in bed.
Snooki comes in.
So what am I gonna do? [Bleep] Throw her out of the room? No.
I see the blanket moving up and down, Snooki's head popping up for air.
We all know what's going down.
[Get crazy by lmfao] Dj Pauly Delvecchio! I'm going to Jersey Shore, bitch! All right, we got a situation.
I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
[Laughing] After I have sex with a guy I will rip their heads off.
Go Vinny! Go Vinny! You like the boobs? If you wanna have fun and do something crazy What the [Bleep] just happened? What did you just do? Let's go do something.
[Groans] You never get me up at 7:00 in the morning.
I'm up! I'm freaking up.
And you know why I'm up? Because I [Bleep] slept in Vinny's bed last night.
I'm up.
If I get a breakfast place, you want to go? I need a girlfriend to talk to right now.
It's 7:30 in the morning, but I see Nicole.
Like, where are you coming from, Nicole? Like, did you pass out in the living room? Went to [Bleep] Vinny's bed.
[Chuckles] Jenni, at this point, I don't give a [Bleep].
I don't care if me and Jionni are done, because he sucks [Bleep].
Honestly, I would never cheat on Jionni, but I said, "we're done," on the phone, and that's why I just went crazy.
It was just it was a rebound reaction.
How drunk were you? Not that drunk.
'Cause I really have to talk to you anyways, 'cause I'm never [Bleep] talking to that kid.
Mike? Yeah.
For what went down and how I defended you last night.
Last night, Mike tells us in the living room when Nicole wasn't around that he got a [Bleep] from her.
I looked Mike dead in the face and I go, "I am telling Nicole.
" I was like, "she will never choose you over Jionni.
" Get that through your head.
" He goes, "well, she [Bleep] sure as hell" chose me over Jionni when she was [Bleep] my [Bleep].
" Crazy pants! You're crazy pants! I didn't do anything.
Yeah, I watched [Bleep] ryder get with his friend.
And that was hot.
Whatever.
But I didn't [Bleep] get with Mike.
And Mike was so upset that I wouldn't hook up with him, 'cause he's not used to rejection.
I want to hairspray him in the face right now.
Why is there so much screaming? What the [Bleep] going on? Get out of my room.
Me get out of your room? Yeah.
For real? Everyone's telling me what the [Bleep] You said about me last night.
We're not friends.
Maybe you should talk to me first.
We're not friends.
It's all good, Snooks.
You're so mean.
'Cause I'm tired of being Mr.
nice.
All right, talk to me first before you talk to 16 other people, all right? I don't want to.
Talk to me first! I'm always nice.
Don't [Bleep] yell at me like that.
We're not friends.
Fine, Snooks.
We're not friends then, Snooks.
Fine, so get out of my room.
All day, baby! Fine.
Wow.
I mean, "get the [Bleep] out"? Like, she's like the fugitive right now and I'm harboring information.
You know what I'm saying? Don't talk [Bleep] and you won't feel like a [Bleep] douchebag.
That's all I have to say.
I just need my best friend.
So I'm like, "Jenni, we're going to get Mimosas.
" I hate you.
Are you ready Nicole? Yeah, let's go.
I'm so tired right now, you crazy whore.
They better have Mimosas at this breakfast, 'cause if they don't, I'm going back to Jersey.
I have to teach her a lesson.
I have to teach Nicole a lesson and the truth has to come out.
So let me just call my boy unit just to refresh my memory on what really happened that night between me and Nicole, my friend unit and ryder.
Yo.
Yo, what up? What up, homey? Yo, you remember when you were banging Snooki's friend ryder? Ryder, yeah, yeah.
Somehow that story got out, you know, throughout the day and there's just been mad arguments.
Really? I know you knew 100% about it, 'cause you were banging ryder, and then Snooki got a little horny, so she got on her [Bleep] real quick.
Really, you put that you put her on blast on that? I did, I definitely did put her on blast.
But you know what I mean.
Snooki turned from 4'9" to about 2'9".
You know what I'm saying? And then after that, she said, "don't ever, ever, ever, ever say anything.
" I said, "pinky swear.
" Thank you for waking up.
I love you.
I just need you in my life.
That's why I jumped out of bed.
Especially, like, right now.
You know what I mean? We'll spend the day together outside.
Do you agree Jionni sucks? Mm hmm.
Jionni sucks.
[Speaking Italian] Oh, that's both for me.
Okay.
Can I have a sip of one? Now I'm gonna look like the bad person you're not.
He pushed you so far.
You're a good girlfriend.
Well, not anymore.
I just wanted to cuddle.
I love him, like, as a best friend.
Did you have sex? No.
I don't remember having sex.
I'm figuring, you know, he [Bleep] on me.
I love Mimosas.
I love sleep.
Gym, tan, and [Bleep] drama today.
G.
T.
D.
Snooki, Jionni.
Pretty much my master plan is: Gym, tan, who's the rat? Oh, man, I'm just getting tired of people just not being nice to me, dog.
Snooki, this morning, she's like, "don't talk to me again.
[Bleep] Dude.
" I was like I'm like, "yo.
" I'm like, "me and you are close.
Like, don't do this.
" I want to show people in this house that you can't believe everything you hear.
So I'm going to tell the roommates a little lie and I'm gonna see who rats themselves out.
She's making me look like a liar, dude.
So I'm like, "you know what, man?" I gave my boy unit Jionni's number.
Said, "call him up and tell him what happened.
" But in reality, all I did is call unit and we talked about the story together and laughed about it.
Gym, tan, [Bleep] Drama today.
G.
T.
D.
Shh Uh oh.
So we'll see what happens now.
Sam had accidentally walked by when I had told Ron.
So now I've planted the seeds, you know? It's gym, tan, who's the rat? Deena.
What happened? I could have sworn I just hear Mike say he's gonna have "the unit" call Jionni.
Why would he [Bleep] do that? I don't know if I heard that right.
That's why I don't know if I should say anything.
You know, like, it's not his business to get involved in.
What an idiot.
He couldn't have said that.
Like, that's [Bleep] up.
I've been up since, like, Me too.
I woke up to people talking [Bleep] about me this morning.
Jenni and Snooks.
That's not cool.
So just to even up the odds, I call my boy unit, like, two hours ago.
I'm like, "dog, they're making me look out to be a liar.
" He's like, "yo, I'll call Jionni right now.
" What's his number?" I got Jionni's number out the phone book and gave it.
Really, Mike, though? I'm not gonna be made to look like a liar.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna flip the [Bleep] out.
You know I'm telling her though.
Yeah, I got to tell her that.
You guys can tell her.
That's [Bleep] up.
That's [Bleep] up.
Don't make me look to be a liar.
Yeah, but that's your friend.
So why is she telling me, "I hate you, don't ever talk to me again"? You need to talk to her, but you should talk to her before you go to that level of calling your friend to call her boyfriend.
That's [Bleep] up.
That's a [Bleep] move.
That's [Bleep] up.
I'm not the one that cheated on my boyfriend.
She did.
Oh, my God, I'm out.
I can't deal with this [Bleep].
If you love your boyfriend, you wouldn't have [Bleep] me.
I don't know what's going on in Mike's twisted head.
He had a really good connection with Nicole.
They were friends.
I'm minding my business.
I don't give a [Bleep].
I feel like that's [Bleep] up.
Friends don't do that.
People who love one another don't do that.
[Chuckles] Mike called the unit to call Jionni and tell him everything that [Bleep] happened with you and Mike.
[Bleep] You, Mike! [Shouting, glass breaks] Nicole! Did you hook up with him? Yes.
Tell Vinny, when I see him, he's dead.
He's done.
No, please don't.
Bongiorno.
Bongiorno.
Bongiorno! You can't even look at me, can you? I'm stopping traffic.
[Shrieks] When people function in the morning this early, this isn't real life to me.
It's like it's a video game.
Oh, my God, I just saw a nun! Ciao! I've never seen a nun before.
She is scared [Bleep] of you.
Oh, my God.
Is that real? Yeah.
I'll buy it off you.
This is very old wine.
Awesome.
How are we gonna get this home? Grazie.
Jenni, look what I got.
A 1981.
Look at.
Wow! So Nicole buys this, like, And we're walking down the [Bleep] Cobblestone Street.
Nicole, you're gonna rip it.
[Glass shattering] Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
My God, no! All of a sudden, this bottle of wine smashes everywhere.
[Laughs] Oh, my God! No! No, no! [Speaking Italian] This [Bleep] sucks balls! [Hip hop music] [Dial tone] Hello? Ma.
Hi.
Hi.
Guess where I'm going Tuesday.
So where you going, Vin? Sicily.
Me and, uh, the boys are going.
We are going to Sicily.
Just the boys.
We're taking a trip to visit my family and see my mother's town where she was born.
This is what I've wanted to do my whole life.
Pauly wants to know if there are any young girl cousins for him.
[Laughter] Hello? Hello? Are there? Ma? [Beeping] [Groans] Oh, oh, oh! You guys want to get some food? Today is laundry.
I don't feel good.
As a joke, I go up to Ronnie I go "Ronnie, man, I called my boy unit up" "Gave him Jionni's number And told him to call Jionni and tell him the deal.
" No, you didn't.
I didn't.
But I told Ronnie I did.
Now, before Ronnie even left the house, he had already told Sam.
[Laughs] But I really didn't call Jionni.
That's brilliant.
[Laughs] So now it's like, "gym, tan, who's the rat?" I don't understand the drama, whatever Mike's intentions were, but I'm just sitting here with my popcorn in my hand waiting for the [Bleep] to pop off.
It's gonna be a [Bleep] show tonight.
No, it's gonna be bad.
Oh, my God.
Work is over already? Oh, my God.
Nicole.
I am so upset about what Mike said this morning that I'm like, Nicole needs to know this.
That was the lowest [Bleep] I've ever heard.
I've gotta tell you what the [Bleep] just happened.
They called the unit to call Jionni and tell him everything that [Bleep] happened with you and Mike.
Stop getting in my business, you mother[Bleep]! Stop [Bleep] getting in my business, you [Bleep]! [Bleep] Stop! Stop! I'm not even kidding, Mike! [Bleep] You! [Bleep] You! You [Bleep] bitch.
[Overlapping arguing] [Bleep] You.
[Bleep] You, Mike.
Mike, I'm not kidding! Nicole! [Bleep].
Nicole.
Don't sit here and feed people lies.
You're feeding everybody in this house lies.
Maybe Nicole isn't being honest.
Maybe Mike's telling the truth about your story.
[Bleep] You.
[Bleep] You.
You [Bleep] bitch.
[Overlapping arguing] Mike, I'm not kidding! Whoa.
Nicole, Nicole.
[Bleep] You.
[Bleep] You, Mike.
[Bleep] You.
You're not [Bleep] part of this house.
Mike's dodging everything like the matrix.
She's throwin' wine bottles at him, he's ducking 'em.
He's moving all around, he's running from her.
[Bleep] You.
[Bleep] You.
What? What the [Bleep]? Why the [Bleep] would you tell unit to [Bleep] call Jionni? I didn't do nothin'.
Why? What is your problem? You wanna know what I did? Say what you did, Mike.
Sam overheard me say, do not do anything, I'll will you listen to me for a I don't like you.
I don't [Bleep] like you.
I don't [Bleep] like you.
I don't [Bleep] like you.
Nicole.
I don't [Bleep] like you.
Nicole, wait.
I hate you.
Nicole, just Hate you.
He didn't do anything.
No.
He didn't do it.
He's it was a joke.
I didn't do it! It was a joke.
He didn't do it.
It was a joke! That's not a funny [Bleep] joke.
Why would you [Bleep] say that, then? It was a joke! That's not funny! Nothin' happened.
Well, you need to ask somebody.
Don't listen from the Peanut Gallery.
Ask people first! 'Cause I didn't make no [Bleep] phone call.
Then why would you go around sayin' that? Why are you [Bleep] talkin' [Bleep]? Stay out of it! Why would you say that? Let her ask first! Why would you say that to me? Let her ask first! Don't look at me, Nicole! He [Bleep] said it! No phone call was ever made! He said it! I was foolin' around because, guess what.
You talked to everybody first, and it backfired on you.
He's a [Bleep].
Mike is trying to prove that me and Deena are rats.
Like, we mean rats.
Like, what's coming out of your mouth right now is straight bull[Bleep].
I didn't do nothin'! Nothing.
All I did was tell three people a little lie because I wanted to see who would rat who out.
And guess what happened.
Sam's the one who ratted herself out.
She immediately ran in the room and ratted.
I didn't do anything, snooki.
Go away! Leave me alone.
[Sniffs] I didn't do anything to you, okay? Get the [Bleep] away from me! I can't just go! Get away from me.
[Bleep] Smile on your face You're a [Bleep] bitch.
Smile on my face How 'bout I make that phone call right now? Get away from me! How 'bout I make a real phone call? Get away from me! How 'bout I make the real Get away! [Sobs] She crying? She's crying.
She's crying over it because she knows it's true.
That I didn't say anything.
Yeah, but by you making her believe it, it's the same effect.
I understand that, but didn't need to prove you said it.
All she had to do was, "Mike, did you make a call?" "Nope, didn't.
" And it would've been solved.
Instead, she just went flippin' out, throwing [Bleep], fightin', and that's exactly how it happens in this house every single time.
It's just messed up 'cause she really cares about the kid, you know? I know.
It looked like she cared last night.
[Laughter] Snooki came into Vinny's bed, wantin' to smush with Vinny.
She told me she was single last night.
So I was like, "all right.
" That's what's up.
I've roomed with Vinny before.
I know what it sounds like when he gets in.
I know what goes down.
And, um, they got it in.
[Chuckles] This is definitely my most well thought out evil plan.
But the prank that I pulled was a necessary evil.
Over this.
[Whining] Jenni! Yeah? Come here.
[Sobs] What's wrong? This is not fun anymore.
Honestly, I gave Mike a couple chances, I feel, here.
But, at this point, when you [Bleep] with me like that, it's done.
And as of right now, I am done with Mike.
Over it.
Done.
Sick [Bleep] kid.
I've been tellin' you that since day [Bleep] one.
He's a sick [Bleep] kid.
Been sayin' that since day one, and nobody wanted to listen to me.
Everyone thought I was the crazy one.
I never liked the kid, Ron.
He's a sick [Bleep] individual.
I don't really know what happened with Mike and Nicole.
Who cares if they [Bleep] hooked up? If you're friends, you don't [Bleep] Pull [Bleep] like you [Bleep] pulled.
Ridiculous.
This was a this was a test, a broadcast system test, you would think he would learn to stop after a while because he got punched in the face, he ran into a wall, and now he's getting champagne bottles thrown at his head.
How many wake up calls does Mike need? Doesn't matter.
That is huge.
The reason why I did that is because I wanted to be done with him.
Well, you are now.
He is gone, so accept it, and move on.
Can we talk about the other night? I wanna know what happened with me and Vinny.
Like, did we have sex and stuff? Did we? All right, let's go outside.
We're going to Sicily today time to wake up.
Yeah, buddy.
Yeah, buddy.
Nicole.
Get up! Here.
This might make you feel better.
We're gonna go to a wine thing, just us girls.
After all the drama that just happened with Mike, this time couldn't have came more perfect.
The boys are going to Sicily so we decided we're going to Tuscany on a wine tour.
We're gonna drink some wine, get some drunk.
It's gonna be fun.
Good morning, boo.
Shh.
You shh! You're not ruining this [Bleep] trip for us.
You have to go.
You're [ ] Going.
I'll pull the blanket right off.
You went to bed before me last night and I've been up for 2 1/2 hours.
Shut the [Bleep] up, Jenni.
We leave in 20 minutes.
I'm not gonna shut up.
I don't give you attitude like this when I Shut up! Have to get you up or I get up for you.
I understand.
Just shut up.
Please, just stop talking to me.
Don't wanna go to this stupid thing.
Well, good morning to you.
We look so sophisticated and classy.
Right? Ew! Nicole.
What? Did you fart? Yeah.
Ugh! Oh, my God, Nicole.
And there goes our class.
[Chuckles] You're in the sixth grade now? [Giggling] I'm so excited to meet my family for the first time.
I'm proud to be sicilian, and this is what life is all about tracing your roots and going to the homeland.
Yep.
Sicily! [Bleep] Sicily.
Oh, my gosh.
Holy [Bleep].
Boys are pumped.
Sicily, here we come.
I hope your family likes me.
Oh, they will, baby.
Don't worry about it.
You might be moving too fast for me.
[Laughter] Yeah, buddy.
Look at these mountains, dude.
Yeah, it's crazy.
I'm seeing Sicily for the first time.
It looks like Jurassic Park.
There's volcanoes, and trees, and mist like, king Kong is in the bushes and it's really nothing like the Italy we've seen so far.
You know, guys, we are doing something crazy right now.
I don't know if you realize it.
Sicily.
No one ventures out this far, like, for real.
This is definitely some Mafia type [Bleep].
I don't know if you've ever seen godfather ii, but [Bleep] it's in Sicily.
We pull up, and there's a ranch.
I'm like Four guidos in the woods? Eh I don't know about that.
Right now I am in the motherland.
My mother's land, literally.
I'm about to meet my family for the first time in Sicily.
This is where I come from, so I'm excited to be here.
Hello.
[Overlapping chatter] Mariucca? Yes.
Ciao.
[Speaking Italian] Hi.
Ciao, ciao.
[Both speaking Italian] [Speaking Italian] This was like the Guadagnino family train.
It was just one family member after another after another whose son's uncle's brother's nephew's cousin's brother's uncle's son.
I'm just like Ciao? [All speaking Italian] Eh, a little bit.
[Laughs] This is sick.
This is like makeout point right here.
All right, let's go.
No, I'm just kidding.
[Laughs] Oh, my God.
We have to take a picture over there.
This is very Italy.
We show up at our first winery.
It was very rustic and old and kind of had, like, a creepy feel to it.
This is one of the oldest castles in Italy still inhabited.
What we do today with you is wine tasting and tours of the 900 year old wine cellar.
Really? Is this haunted? Not anymore.
Oh Not anymore? Okay.
Follow me.
Ew, this is creepy.
No, I don't like this.
Don't go off by yourself, stupid.
Scream if you get lost.
[Whines] We're walking down in the cellars and the basement and stuff like that.
And it's frickin' scary! Like, this is haunted.
Boo! [Screams] [Laughs] [Sighs] It really was haunted.
I could feel.
I got the vibe.
You want to go upstairs and taste some wine? Yeah! Whoo hoo! Yeah.
Shh.
I'll bring this back to Deena.
[Chuckles] [Speaking Italian] Michael.
[Speaking Italian] If you want to be Italian, you have to know how to play soccer.
I play soccer.
Goalkeeper over here.
[Laughter] Come on.
[All cheer] Nice shot! All: Oh! No, no, no.
[Bell tolls] Nice job.
That was the money shot.
Perfect.
[Laughter] Look, she's got pictures of my family at home.
Oh, really? Yeah, yeah.
I want to share this one.
There's me when I was like [Bleep] 13.
Oh, let me see that.
Oh, no way! [Laughter] Oh, we gotta see that one.
All: Aah! My awkward phase! [Laughter] That was my awkward phase.
Hey, baby.
[Laughter] five of you at any time.
[Laughs] This is the best day of my life on the camera.
We'll have the wine tasting with the food.
Cool.
The first one I'm gonna serve is [Speaking Italian] That's the name of the winery.
Okay, we're gonna start off with a 2009.
This is the villa wine right now.
You can see this wall is that was, uh, bombed during world war ii.
Cool.
History.
Boo! Like, you know? Like, I'm not into geography anymore.
Give me [Bleep] wine.
This is the ultimate wine to serve with a steak.
Color, what they call [Belches] Excuse me.
When you grill, it kind of makes it a little bit bitter.
I just want her to shut up so I can talk about Jionni right now.
Like, I'm going through issues.
I don't give a [Bleep] about how wine's made.
Now just do your own thing.
Like you're just at a regular meal.
You don't want us to do our own thing.
We'd embarrass you.
Me and Deena would be on the tables.
[Laughs] Can we talk for a second and make me happy? Yeah.
What's wrong? Jionni Yeah.
What am I gonna do? That thing with freaking Vinny could have ruined it.
Yeah, why'd you do that? 'Cause he pissed me off to the point where at this moment, I know you want someone, but you doing that with Vinny no offense, like, the damage is done.
I want to, like, put it out there.
I want to be with him though.
Honestly, I really think at this point you should move on.
I do too.
If you want my real opinion, that kid won't forgive you for it.
So you gotta man up to your mistake and realize that it's over because of that.
I love him.
No, you don't.
If you loved him, you wouldn't have done that with Vinny.
Jenni just told Nicole the truth.
You know when somebody tells you you're doing something wrong, and you don't wanna like hear it? That's what I feel like Nicole is doing.
Honestly, though, I'm calling you out on you being wrong right now for the simple fact that you laid up in his bed I told you why I did that the only reason why It doesn't matter.
That is not an excuse.
'Cause I wanted to be done with him.
You are now.
You can't change it.
The damage is done.
She's being the worst best friend this whole time.
The worst.
And on top of what Mike's saying so that's when I was like, "bye.
" This kid is going to have enough.
I'm sorry.
I would never do that.
I would never cheat on him.
You did, though.
That kid will have enough, and he is gone.
So accept it and move on.
You're [Bleep] airing your best friend out right now.
What the [Bleep]? Do you want my opinion, or you want the truth? Jenni's being such a bitch to me, I can't even take her.
He [Bleep] me, and that's it.
I would never do that.
I would never cheat on him.
You did, though.
I want to be with this kid.
He is not for you.
Nicole stops the wine tasting and wants our opinion on her and Jionni.
If you loved him, you wouldn't have done that with Vinny.
We didn't have sex, okay? I mean, I was right there, so I'm thinking in my head, like, she did sex, but I'm not gonna put her on blast like that.
At the time, honestly, I was, like, I don't give a [Bleep].
Me and Jionni are done.
I'm done with this kid.
He's making me feel miserable.
Now now that I think about it, I [Bleep] love him, and I can't believe I did that.
He's gonna be so beyond humiliated from the simple fact that his girlfriend, after two hours of getting in a fight, hooked up with Vinny.
He'll never accept it.
He'll never go on that and I don't want to be that person to say it to you, but as a best friend, move on.
My best friend would never do that to me and just say [Bleep].
Jenni's really not there for me like I thought she was.
[Men speaking Italian] Getting to know my family is like an experience.
It's a choreography.
It's like a dance.
[Overlapping chatter] It's like course after course after course.
So much food, just like back home.
They literally keep piling it on.
[Speaking italian] My stomach's gonna explode.
Guys, leave some room because it's not over yet.
We just started.
[Laughter] Salud.
Salud.
My family, thank you for letting me and my friends come here.
My whole life, I dreamed about coming here and having this meal.
And right now it's coming true.
So it's amazing, and thank you, and I love all of you.
Beautiful.
[All make various toasts] You're welcome here anytime you want.
All right, thank you.
[Laughter] [Screams] You okay? Oh, no, did we hurt his bike? Did we hurt his bike? I would say us girls definitely went through about, like, ten bottles of wine.
[Laughter] [Speaking Italian] Today was a good time.
It's not over yet.
I'm horny.
It smells like a fart.
Eww, who just ripped ass? [Laughter] Oh, my God.
Here you'll find four different types of wood.
And so this blend of oh, my God, I'm so tired.
Like, I can't even drink wine anymore, and he's talking about these wine barrels and wah wah wah.
And different [Chuckles] I think your your friend is sleeping.
Probably [Laughs] Too many bottles for I'm awake.
I'm awake.
We're shot.
We're drunk.
Everything that this guy's saying, we already learned.
So it's just basically, like, bring on the wine and cheese.
What kind did you get? I guess I'll take the strong one that I always fall for.
Maybe you shouldn't.
Me? Yeah.
Don't talk [Bleep], 'cause I'll air it all out right now.
Snap out of it.
I'm fine.
I'm annoyed.
Don't be mad about the truth.
The whole Mike and Nicole drama comes up.
I see, like, maybe Jionni thinks, like, something else happened.
You act like we're not best friends.
We are, but don't sit here and cry and feed people lies.
You're feeding everybody in this house, besides me, lies.
Maybe Nicole isn't being honest.
Maybe Mike's telling the truth about their story.
If I am your best friend, why can't you have someone to tell you the truth? No, actually, you're not anymore.
'Cause none of my best friends would ever say that.
I would never do that to a best friend.
I'm not doing anything.
You're [Bleep] airing your best friend out right now.
What the [Bleep] are you talking about? You just said, "if you're gonna [Bleep] air me out" Exactly You're airing me out now.
Why would you make a stupid comment like that? I don't need this.
I need you.
I'm supposed to sugarcoat it? I am here for you.
Yeah, you're supposed to sugarcoat it to make me happy.
No, you that's why I asked you earlier, do you want my opinion, or do you want the truth? Jenni's being such a bitch to me, I can't even take her.
You're gonna hate me.
What? Remember when I told you what happened with Vinny? Yeah.
Something more happened.
I would never do that to a best friend.
Would you speak the truth, or would you sugarcoat it? We would [Bleep] we tell each other the truth all the time.
Thank you.
And that's exactly what I did right here, and she can't [Bleep] handle it.
Nicole, at this point, is making up lies to people so they can say it's gonna be all right.
Maybe it's not gonna be all right, Nicole.
And you know what? Man up, and fix it yourself.
If you want to share this type of information with me, you have to expect an opinion, and you got to expect when you're gonna do wrong or right.
That's Nicole, though.
I feel like Jenni like, I love her to death, and I would [Bleep] die for her.
I swear to God, I would die for her.
But she's just being a not a good friend to me.
This should be a great cab ride.
[Scoffs] Yeah.
Oh, God.
[Exhales deeply] Here's your glasses.
Oh, thank you.
I was looking for them.
Nicole, I've got a little bag for your to put all the stuff in.
This whole time is supposed to be fun wine night, like, and this is, like, the worst ride home.
Like, everybody's quiet, and it's just awkward.
And I just want to punch somebody in the face.
Like, this is not how it was supposed to be.
[Traditional Italian music] [Speaking italian] Si.
I'm the second generation.
The third generation.
The fourth.
Everybody.
Every generation is together right now.
Even though I never met these people in my life, we're just blood, so it's just an instant connection.
This guy right here you see how much he's smiling? He makes us all smile.
And their family takes us in like family.
Just like the one back home, right? We love your family, kid.
I'm glad I did this.
Forever we'll remember this forever.
You know what I mean? For real.
I wonder what the girls are up to right now.
[Laughs] Me an Jenni are not on good terms right now.
If you want to keep your friendship, talk to her about it.
Nicole knows, at this point, that I am agitated.
We're covering up for her, and I am done taking on her attitude, and I'm over it.
Hey, you.
Never again, boo.
Mm mm.
Okay.
I love you.
Okay.
Me and Jenni like, when we fight, we fight.
And we will legit kill each other, but at the end of the day, we still love each other.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
I'm sorry.
I hated you so much.
I'm sorry.
I did, too.
The thing is, I get so mad, 'cause I know you just feel guilty, but you're not doing anything to get rid of the guilt.
And I'm You're frustrated with how I'm acting, I feel.
I get it.

He caused this.
Okay? Fine.

So, you know, I just wanted to talk to Jionni and just say, "first of all, I'm [Bleep] at you" "for changing your Facebook status to single.
"Like, who does that, if you really want to be with me? And also, I have to tell you something really bad.
" [Line trilling] Hello? Hi.
Can I talk to you? No! Why do you want to talk to me? You broke up with me! You broke my [Bleep] heart! I said, "a break"! I didn't say I [Bleep] want to break up with you! And then my dad has to [Bleep] tell me that you put on Facebook you're single? Are you that excited to get [Bleep]? Really? Why would you do that? Yesterday on the phone you said to me, "I can't be with you anymore.

Hi, girls.
Hey! Mm, I miss you so much.
Yeah? Can we talk about the other night? So I know what to tell Jionni? What do you mean, what happened? I asked you if you were drunk.
You said no.
I wanna know what happened with me and Vinny 'cause I don't exactly know.
Like, did we have sex and stuff? Like, I have no idea.
What, you can't remember what you did? That's how drunk you were? I don't believe you.
I remember certain things that I don't wanna say, did we [Bleep] smush? Don't say [Bleep].
I just wanna know what to tell him.
You wanna know every little detail? Mm hm.
All right, let's go outside.
It was like a glitch in the Matrix.
Like, everything is happening the way it's supposed to be, then all of a sudden, glitch in the Matrix.
Whoa, bang Snooki.
And then everything just continued the way it was happening before.
So you were in my bed.
You climbed into my bed.
Mm hm.
And then Whatever, we were just cuddling.
And then, like, you started, like, kissing my neck a little bit.
And then you just kept saying, like, "[Bleep] Me.
" [Laughter] Stop, stop.
You were [Bleep] horny.
Stop it! [Bleep].
Vinny, you don't have to say that! Oh, my God! Why would you say that? [Laughs] Oh, my God.
Whatever.
I thought we were just, like, cuddling and My [Bleep] was cuddling with your [Bleep], but I have to tell him.
Tell him.
Don't lie.
I really, honestly thought we didn't have sex.
Like, I blacked out a little bit.
What are you gonna do? Freaking out.
Just going somewhere.
And I told Jionni that we just [Bleep] popped.
Now I have to call him back and say, "well, you sittin' down? We actually really had sex.
" [Sighs] Oh, dear [Bleep] God.
Oh! [Phone rings] Hello? You're gonna hate me.
What? Remember what I told you what happened with Vinny? Yeah.
Something more happened.
What? Uh I don't even wanna say it.
Say what? Uh We had sex.
[Sighs] 
Fist pump, pushup, chapstick.
I love Italy! Going to Italy was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and a dream that I've had my whole life.
Ooh, look at that butt.
- He's a cutie.
Nice ass.
I think the statue of David's pretty sexy.
I would do it.
She has no underwear on! Italy was a great time, but we all knew there was gonna be drama.
What happened? Where's my boyfriend? Jionni! Nobody knows about this.
Me and Snooki hooked up, like, two, three months ago.
Mike called the unit to call Jionni and tell him everything that [Bleep] happened with you and Mike.
I didn't! - [Bleep] You, Mike! I didn't! - Mike, I'm not kidding! Oh, Nicole!! - I [Bleep] Hate you! Who's gonna be the bad guy? Situation? No problem.
I've roomed with Vinny before, I know what goes down, and they got it in.
I ended up in Vinny's bed.
Did you hook up with him? - Yes.
Oh, Vinny is dead.
Who wants to leave Italy and go to Jersey? Let's go to Jersey, bitch! Dj Pauly Delvecchio! I'm going to the Jersey shore, bitch! All right, we got a situation.
I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
After I have sex with a guy, I will rip their heads off.
Go Vinny! Go Vinny! You like the boobs? Arrivederci! Jersey, here we come! Peace out, Italy.
- Jer-sey! Jer-sey! Let's go, let's go.
This is it.
- Yeah, let's do it.
I'm ready to go home to America.
I cannot get a haircut out here, I can't go tanning out here, and the gym sucks; I'm going to Jersey.
we've done everything you could possibly do, I think, in Florence, and we're ready to go be in our element at the Jersey shore.
Me and croc are off to Jersey.
Bye, Italy.
It's been real.
But honestly, I need my homeland of guides on the boardwalk.
Whoo! Holla.
I just feel like ? ahh I'm so excited to be home.
You have no idea.
America up.
Yay, England! I want a big, fat burger.
Remember that, [Bleep].
I'll never leave you again.
We're so excited to see America.
I feel like I was at boarding school, and America's my mother, and I'm coming home to my mother right now.
Feels nice to see signs I can actually read.
Now, I'm letting everybody know in this house right now that I do not care what room I go in.
The legit problem is nobody wants to room with Mike.
Mike seems to get himself in everybody's drama, no matter who it is, he loves to stir up some bull[Bleep].
I don't want him to bring that to our room.
I want my old bed.
- I want my bed.
I'm the only one in the house that has a I like my bed.
My bed is my bed, and like, I peed in it last year, so who would want to sleep in that bed? So that's the consensus, we're all taking our old rooms? If that's what it is, that's what it is.
Oh, my God.
This sucks.
Guys, we're going over the bridge.
Here we come, Jersey! Seaside heights, bitches.
- I can't believe it.
We're about to pull up to the house.
I'm gonna throw up! It's right there! Get the [Bleep] out.
Who's just running upstairs? - I am.
This is crazy.
Oh, my God! What the hell? Look at my duck phone! - Oh, my God! Yaaay! It's so clean! Are the hermit crabs still in here? I can't believe this is happening right now.
Like, I'm finally home.
Me and Vinny are so excited that Vinny immediately jumps on my bed, and like, dry humps me on my bed, just to break it in like old times.
Oh, I'm so happy this is our room, bro.
There's no way I woulda taken any other room.
Nope.
Flippin' [Bleep], and having temper tantrums, and crying and [Bleep], I won't stand for that, bro.
I won't stand for that.
- Upstairs is the crying room.
I won't stand for that.
- That's the upstairs room.
I don't even know where to put half my [Bleep].
I can't believe that I'm living in a room with Mike again.
Who wants to room with Mike? Nobody.
This is like, the divider.
I guess the middle right here.
I've lived with Ron and Sam last year I want nothing to do with you.
Move out the room.
I'll move this [Bleep] myself.
You psycho! And then I lived again with Ron in Italy, which, obviously, that didn't work out too well.
I don't give a [Bleep] about your relationship! You wanna [Bleep] do it? Stop it! I don't know, I just I'm just trying to put it behind me.
And, you know, maybe we could be friends again.
Or not.
No problems this time.
Like, I really don't want any issues.
Not with me.
I'll let you do your thing, I don't care.
Let's make sure we're cool.
We're cool.
We're gonna keep the same rooms, but if he does get involved in my relationship, I will be forced to put his bed on the porch.
Just don't get involved in any relationship [Bleep] this time.
I'm I'm I'm cool.
- Thank you so much.
It's like the never-ending bag trip.
God, you'd think there's Wow.
This is gonna be an issue.
Shoulda took a shot before we did this.
Hey, would you like some room with these bags? I'm not unpacking right now.
I'm over this.
Let's have fun.
Oh, my God! Let's do a pickle shot! Eww, Nicole.
Oh, my God! I never knew how much I missed pickles and pickle juice.
It's like an overwhelming feeling that I can't even explain, I mean, it's just weird.
My two loves.
A shot to the seaside.
- I'm making Ron-Ron juice.
- Ooh, I want a Ron-Ron juice.
Yeah, who would ever thought I'd miss this house? That's a good batch, right there.
Oh, wow, Ronnie.
I should be a waitress.
All: Yay! Whoo! We're in seaside, bitches! - Cheers to seaside! Here's to a good summer.
- Here's to a good summer! Seaside! What a good time! - Oh, yeah! I say we hit the boardwalk.
Let's go, let's go.
We're gonna go to the t-shirt shop first.
We're going to see Danny.
Finally, we're hitting the boardwalk.
We all decide to go and check out the shore store, because we are gonna be working there again.
Shore! What's up, guys? The guidos are here! This is the palest I've ever seen.
You're all Vinny's color.
I kinda like it.
It's your third year.
I'm expecting you guys to be the pro veterans this year.
Schedule's up here.
So you guys should write it down.
Yo, can I be the press manager? It feels great to be back in the t-shirt shop.
As crazy as that sounds, I can't wait to work again.
You guys happy to be back? - Hell, yeah.
I wanna hear all the stories about Italy, so I was hoping that tomorrow at, like, 7:00 I'm gonna take you guys out for drinks.
We're gonna go do Captain hook's, all right? Yeah! Captain hook's! Great to be back, my dude! Let's go to the boardwalk! Hitting the boardwalk for the first time, one big, dysfunctional family, it's the perfect initiation back.
Oh, I'm just so happy to be home.

What's the plan, Sam? Yo, we're gonna make it happen today.
All-American errands today.
All unfinished business will be finished today.
Yeah, 'cause I need to go gmttl.
First thing I wanna do now that I'm back in America is I want to go tanning.
I'm as pale as a ghost.
I'm almost as white as my teeth.
Come on, I'm getting paler by the minute.
Ronnie, let's roll! - Enjoy your day, fellas! Oh, my God, have so much fun.
- Get tan! Get tan! Oh, God.
I'd rather go tanning first.
This is a serious situation right now.
We're losing weight, and we're getting pale.
It's like the end of civilization.
You should probably go on a like a medium bed.
[Bleep] That, I wanna shock my system.
You're going hard-hard? I'm tanorexic, bro.
The tanning salon's gonna be coming up on the right-hand side.
I have an emergency! I have an emergency! We are pale.

Ah, I feel [Bleep] good, man.
This is America.
I can breathe, like, I smell the smog, I love it.
Yeah, I love it.
Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice messag Oh, my God.
I'm missing Jionni so much.
Last time I seen Jionni, it was in Italy, and it was like the worst time ever for us, and then I hooked up with Vinny, and you know, Just got crazy.
So, honestly, I don't even know what's going on with Jionni.
It's hot in here.
Our air conditioner unless I'm freaking out.
I just wanna hear Jionni's voice.
This sucks.
I haven't talked to him in so long.
I know that feeling.
It's been forever since I've seen Roger.
It's horrible.
It's gonna feel so good to get a haircut.
Yo, my bad, we got no no appointment, no nothing.
We just happy to be back.
First day back.

He looked like one of the three stooges.
Vinny, you wanna do this? - Yeah, buddy.
Don't make fun of the hair, son.
Vinny been cutting my hair.
You want a job? I'm so happy to see American barbers that use straight-edge razors, and the right clippers, and they know how to fade, and shape up, and tape up.

Look at his hair.
Turn around.
Turn around.
What the hell? That's sick, vin.
- And he got a tan.
Look at you.
He's officially a guido now! Vinnie's hair I think it's like a mixture between a mullet, a Mohawk, and a Fauxhawk.
I don't even know what to call that.
But it looks good on him.
Wow, vin.
All right.
Vin's a juicehead! In training.
No.
You look good with a blowout.
Yo, let's roll out! I just have unbelievable genetics.
Holy boobs.

- We have to go this way.
No, it's the next block.
Danny invites us to Captain hook's for drinks and stuff like that.
Honestly, like, we just got to seaside.
I don't wanna go to a bar and hang out with my boss.
But hopefully he's paying for the drinks.
Here we go.
- Is that it? It's dead.
That sucks.
How many cars are here? Like, five? Ugh, lame.
I see, like, an empty bar.
And all of a sudden What the [Bleep]? Who is that? I could not believe my eyes.
What the hell? Snooki's gonna be drinking, and there's gonna be mad drama.
Tonight can get ugly real quick.
You [Bleep] idiot, I will start with you.
I'm homesick.
I can't do it.
'Cause I know right now he wants to jump.
I'm about to bounce, bro.
I wanna say hello to Daniel.

That sucks.
What's goin' on, man? Who is that? We walked into Captain hook's I just see everybody's friends and family.

Love you, pal.
My God, like, our family's here.
Everybody's here that we've missed so much.
I see my dad, my best friend ryder, and Jionni.
I was so excited.
Hopefully this means I've been given a second chance with Jionni.
I just want to be with him.
That's all I ever want in life is to be with, you know, the person that I love, and that's him.
I missed you.
I don't know, like, whether to be happy or sad.
Why, Vinny? I'm just in disbelief.
You know, I haven't seen my mom in so long, I feel.
And I'm literally in shock, I think, for the first time in my life.
Oh Welcome home, buddy.
Stop crying, okay? Oh Just happy to see you, vin.
I don't know, it's just seeing your family makes you realize how much you miss them.
Dude.
- Surprised? Worked out amazing, huh? I'm, like, shaking right now.
How are you? Oh, Snooki cookie Bella Pauly d! That's Vinny's uncle Nino.
Uncle Nino's back, he's drunk.
He's hitting on every girl in the place.
Uncle Nino.
Uncle Nino is the ultimate creep.
I feel like he should be in this house with us.
Honestly, he should get the smush room.
My buddy Mike! [Laughs] I didn't see uncle Nino.
He's with Mike's family right now.
Like, hey! He forgot what family he's with.
Uncle Nino! When you're done talking to your nephew, come meet Vinny! Hi, babe.
How are you? - Good.
Tonight, the only thing I'm really worried about is Jionni.
You have Jionni and Nicole, who haven't seen each other, and there's kinda like unfinished business, and then you have Jionni with Vinny, Jionni with Mike.
It's like, tonight can get ugly real quick.
Missed you.
- Missed you.
How are you? I'm okay, how are you? - Aww, love you.
Awkward.
You okay? - Yeah.
You look beautiful.
- Thank you.
Who else is here? Vinny's sisters.
Have you ever met my daughters? No? I'll bring them over.
I feel bad for Jionni right now.
I would feel like a loser if I was in a room with the dude that slept with my girlfriend behind my back.
Such a perfect couple.
Aww.
What a perfect couple.
Look at that.
I wish I had a digital camera.
I can predict the future, and I will let you know that tonight, um, snooki's gonna be drinking, and there's gonna be mad drama tonight.
Automatically.
Automatically.
I'm so ready for it.
My boy unit's here.
I mean, this is like the perfect storm.
Ryder and unit were witness to myself and Snooki gettin' down two months prior While she's been with Jionni.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm gonna go hang out with Jionni.
No, no, no, stop, stop, stop.
- I like Jionni.
I like Jionni, but just - I'm gonna go make you're gonna go [Bleep] with him.
No, I'm gonna go hang out with him.
I like him.
He's cool as hell.
Everybody knows the story, but it hasn't been confirmed.
Now the witnesses are here.
It's only a matter of time before the truth's coming out.
Hey, what's up, baby? Yo, um, hey, this guy right here is coming back to the crib.
Is that cool? I don't know what's going on, but I don't trust Mike and the unit.
So I don't want him in the house.
What do you think? What is that puss on your face, Snooki? Shut up.
Smile.
Damn.
You're so annoying, unit, like, who are you? Whatever.
Your [Bleep] hair's curly, you look like a [Bleep] ass[Bleep] right now.
No, don't make me tell you - You need to gel your hair.
Yo, do you want me to tell you about y No, stop, stop, stop, stop - I love I can be funny.
I can be very funny.
Tell me about myself.
I can be very funny.
- I wanna hear it.
Tell me about myself.

Stop, stop, stop, stop - Tell me about myself.
I wanna hear it.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop Because you [Bleep] ride off [Bleep] Mexico town, so what the [Bleep] do you have to say? I wasn't making fun of you - No, what do you have to say? You're a [Bleep] loser.
It's not funny.
If you didn't have Mike, you'd be a [Bleep] loser.
You [Bleep] idiot.
Let me know when you want to be funny, and let's get hilarious, you know what I mean? If you wanna start, you [Bleep] idiot, I will start with you.
Stop, stop, stop, stop Nicole's just going off, saying really mean things.
It's probably the stupidest thing you can do because this is the key witness to the crime.
How are you friends with a person like that? Snooki, I got you, girl.
I got you.
Oh, you got me? - No, stop, stop.
No, stop You got me? - I got you, girl.
[Bleep] Unit? Your name's [Bleep] unit, you moron! I got you, girl.

Okay, unit! Okay, unit! - Keep talking.
I got you, girl.
Okay, unit.
Get real, bitch! I got you so good! Get [Bleep] real! Watch your [Bleep], girl! Get [Bleep] real.
You're such an idiot.
Can I talk to you for five seconds? No, I don't like him.
- Just listen.
Don't instigate, and I won't tell him to instigate, because you know what's gonna happen.
Did I instigate, Mike? This is the most funniest thing I've seen in years him trying to console her.
You love your boyfriend, right? No [Bleep], you know that.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Ass[Bleep].
- Okay.
But he will say something, Snooki, if you keep saying something.
I promise he won't say anything.
I promise.
You okay? Fine, I just I don't [Bleep] like unit.
So just everybody, just be nice.
I think Snooki hooked up with Mike.
At this point, I really believe it.
Just the way she was when Mike was around Jionni, and the way she was when unit got close to them, or unit said anything to her, it's that guilty conscience.
- Was he hitting on you? - No, I just don't like him.
I don't want him near me.
Uh, I gotta go to the bathroom.
I got a question.
What happened with Nicole and Mike in that room? Nicole and Mike in that room when I was with ryder? What did you see? Did you see anything? Maybe you didn't see anything.
Believe me, I saw everything.
And if she wasn't trying to bring down my night, I'm gonna bring down her night.
You ready to leave? - Yeah.
I don't see this turning to be a good night.
Like, I'm actually afraid to go home.
Time for war.
You guys gonna make out? 'Cause that'd be awesome.
Pauly and ry are, like, flirting.
You could tell it's definitely bothering Deena.
Stop.
You don't wanna start, you [Bleep] idiot? I will start with you.
How did this turn into so much drama? 'Cause unit's a [Bleep] [Bleep].
I don't want there to be any drama.
I just told her, "hang out with Jionni" That's what I thought.
"I'm gonna hang out with him, and that's it.
" And then she's like, "I don't care, I hate your friend.
" "I hate your yeah [Bleep] Him.
" Why? - And I'm like because she thinks he's gonna say something.
Yeah, but you [Bleep] said it all in Italy.
But not while two witnesses are there.
This party is turning into a disaster.
Nicole and unit are fighting, and Mike's stepping in.
Like, I don't see this turning to be, like, a good night.
Unit's being a [Bleep]er.
- I talked to him.
Who? - He said unit.
You know what they're trying to do right now.
But he's not, 'cause he didn't.
He didn't what? - Can you turn the water on? Yeah.
- He hasn't said anything.
About what? - About being in that room.
But he said if you keep [Bleep] with him, he's gonna bull[Bleep] you.
All right, do that, then.
No.
Do you want Jionni involved? Um, obvi, no.
All right, so are we gonna walk away from this at the house? I saw you earlier talking to who you shouldn't be talking to.
And I'm like, Jionni Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes Yo, Ronnie, do you wanna know something funny? All two witnesses are gonna be in the same house, the same time with the boyfriend.
Like, that's [Bleep] crazy.
That's, like, ironic.
Poetic.
It's insane.
Nicole shouldn't be blowing up on the unit if he has dirt.
That's like a that's like a bad chess move, right there.
That's checkmate for Snooki.
It's like she should be chillin' she should be licking my ass[Bleep].
Yes, yes, she should be.
But she's not.
Sorry.
I freaked out a little bit.
What happened? I left for literally 15 minutes, and you were all pissed off.
It's bull[Bleep].
Was it about me? Last call.
It was great to see you, my man.
So good to have you back.
Glad you guys came.
It was a surprise.
Come back as soon as I can.
Both: I love you.
Thank you so much.
- You're the best.
Thanks a lot, man.
- You're the best.
I'm glad you guys were surprised.
I love you, I miss you.
- I will call you.
All right, bye, mom.
Be good, all right? Honestly, I'm glad that the party's over.
I was already spinning, emotionally.
Just coming home and transitioning from Italy to Jersey, and seeing my family just puts the [Bleep] washing machine on overload.
All right, be careful getting home.
All right, bye.
- Love you.
Love you.
- Bye, vin.
Bye, vin.
- Bye.
You ready to leave? - Yeah.
You ready to leave, go back to the crib? You guys ready to go back to the crib? Yeah.
- All right.
Let's roll.
Come on.
Ugh.
What's the matter? Let's go, let's go.
It's off to the house, and my boy jonny unit is coming with me.
At any moment, something could pop off.
This is hurricane situation.
Okay? And it's heading straight for Snooki island.
I can't believe unit's staying here.
Go, and take a go straight, and take a left.
Take a left.
Quick.
Come on.
Where are we? What is this? This is my room.
All right, so Where's Snooki? I don't know.
I don't want unit or Mike to start any drama, because they're ass[Bleep], and it's not necessary.
So when the unit's in the house, I'm just gonna go in my room and smush Jionni.
I have my shoes on.
- Shush.
It will get crazy downstairs, so you need to be prepared.
Oh, I'm so ready.
Do you want a white or a black tank top right now? I don't wear a shirt.
- All right, all right.
You do what you wanna do.
Yo, it's the best you've ever looked.
Right? Sick, right? Hell yeah.
- It's nasty.
Um, I have whatever you obviously need.
Face wash, whatever.
Do you need new drawers or not? Yeah, why not? Yeah, yeah, you can take your pants off.
Oh, my God.
Like, let's be real.
I just feel like Mike has, like, gay tendencies.
See, you're getting naked right here, buddy.
Oh, I thought they said go to the bathroom, I was about to No, no.
All right, cool.
I'm getting naked right here.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Get me outta here.
Ugh This is just so weird.
Mike normally wifes up his grenades this way.
Is he doing that with unit? Is it supposed to smell like skunk up here? It's not me.
All right, we about to go downstairs.
Just gimme one second, put moisturizer on, and we're out.
Time for war.
Let's make it happen.
My boy unit, he's got all the information I got.
And he wants to blow it wide open.
Especially since Snooki was mean to him tonight.
So I could just sit back and just watch the show.
We need food.
Where is everybody? What's goin' on? - What up? We're trying to make burgers.
It's not successful.
Where's Snooki? - She just went to bed.
Snooki knows what's going on.
So she eliminates Jionni from the equation.
And you wanna know how? Snooks? She hid.
She hid the whole night.
What did you just say? Pauly and ry are like flirting.
You could tell it's definitely bothering Deena.
'Cause Deena always wanted to get it on with Pauly.
'Sup, my ninja? Are you guys gonna make out? 'Cause that'd be awesome.
You're drunk.
Nah.
You? Like, Ryder's really riding around town in this house.
Like, seriously.
Vinnie, the unit, now Pauly.
I'll show you where you're sleeping tonight, all right? Are we gonna cuddle? Yeah.
What now? - I don't know.
Let's play.
- What do you wanna do? I don't know.
- Ciao.
What's up? - Tired.
Bye.
Whatever.
I'm happy.
Awesome.
What up? - I'm just tired, my dudes.
I'm sorry.
Ryder's looking pretty good tonight, but she's already had sex with Vinny.
And I'm not really cool with Vinny's sloppy seconds.
So I don't know what to do with her.
Wait, could we have fun? What're you trying to do? - I don't know.
But I don't want to be rude, so.
Whether you're the first man in, or the last man in, ryder.
Let's do something crazy.
Nicole has gotta bend jon right now, 'cause she knows Jon's got her.
What's up, Snooki? He tried to break me and Jionni up.
Good morning.
What do you wanna wear? You could pick any t-shirt you want.
'Sup, pal? Everybody ride her.
Just like a bus route.
You didn't [Bleep] ryder yet, right? Hell yeah.
Oh, yeah, you did.
Ryder's [Bleep] everybody in the house.
If she [Bleep] Ronnie, it's like guido bingo.
I don't like sloppy 23rds.
'Sup, bro? Looking for breakfast? - Yeah, definitely.
You got your Metro card? Why, so everybody can ride her? Just like a bus route? Can we go to get breakfast? Let's go.
- We'll be back.
Bye.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
That was fun yesterday.
Snooki was mean as hell to him yesterday.
What's happening, buddy? That kid has to be one of the nicest kids I've ever met.
Yeah, he's a good kid.
Come on.
They're trying to [Bleep] with me.
I'm gonna go have a cigarette.
Try to be nice while I'm gone.
Let me know if she says anything to you I mean, gives you permission I mean, I want an apology.
I do want an apology.
I never get Mike.
I don't know who he's trying to be today.
Is he gonna be the nice guy, or is he gonna be the [Bleep]head that's trying to, you know, [Bleep] [Bleep] Up? I don't like your friend.
You were me you were me you were mean to him last night.
I don't like him.
He's a [Bleep].
I know, but you said some pretty mean things.
Well, [Bleep], he pissed me off last night.
But you definitely said some pretty mean things to him last night.
He's actually a little upset.
You should apologize, 'cause the ingredients of the bomb are here right now.
I mean, Nicole has got to bend jon right now, 'cause she knows Jon's got her.
Where you going? - I wanna see something.
What's up, Snooki? I'm sorry about last night.
I don't I don't believe that apology.
I didn't mean it last night.
I was drunk, and I was just a lunatic.
I'm sorry.
You know, people get outta line, and they say the wrong things, and sometimes it gets 'em in trouble.
What, so you're gonna do something back to me because I got drunk and said something stupid to you? No, I - I'm apologizing to you.
I don't like to apologize.
That's not me.
What's not you? Apologizing and admitting that I'm wrong.
But it is you just, like, going off on somebody for no apparent reason? Is that you? When I'm drunk, yes.
Mike knows.
I have a little bit of anger issues.
I'm sorry.
All right, you know what.
Apology's the first step.
I'll take that as a first step.
I apologized to unit, but I don't give a [Bleep] about unit.
I only did it because Mike's you know, told me to.
Take it for what it is.
I'm a nice dude.
I know you are.
I'm so surprised that she apologized.
And that was a good move by her.
If we do something now, it's gonna make us look bad.
You know what I'm saying? But we got the whole summer.
So we'll see what happens.
This [Bleep] has some game.
- Yeah, she does.
Guidos are here.
- Ryder! Did you guys make babies? Yeah, buddy.
We gotta go, so.
Love you, kid.
- See you, dog.
I love you.
- Love you.
See you later.
- Guys talk tonight.
I've been away from my family for a long time now, and I'm a little homesick.
I don't know.
It's it's a weird kind of feeling.
Seeing my mother last night, it kinda like, makes it a little worse I feel.
'Sup, bro? - What up? All right? - No, I feel like [Bleep].
What's wrong? My family.
Depressed? Yeah.
At this point, yeah.
What makes you happy? Know what I mean, something that makes you happy.
Seeing my family, you know, for real.
Not seeing them over here.
Yeah, for one night.
I know.
Like, I need Like, I I need an escape.
You know? I think the fact that Vinny is so taken care of at home by his mom, that's affecting him a lot.
"I'm hungry," his mom cooks him dinner.
"I'm dirty," his mom wipes his ass.
I don't know, I think Vinny needs to kind of man up and, like, move on.
Want me to get you a stripper? No? Hooker? God, you wanna do sex? No, I mean with a hooker.
Help me.
Oh, boy.
She's battling you! She's battling you! Mike, do you want a shot or no? Whatever you want.
Jionni's buying me drinks all night.
And I'm thinking in the back of my head, like, wow, dude, if you only knew.
Hello? - Nicole.
Are you at Aztec? Yeah, where the hell are ya? - I'm coming.
Yo, you trying to go to Aztec? Yeah, just give me 10, What are you doing? I might stay too.
- You gonna stay? Yeah.
Wanna go to Aztec? Like, if you wanna go, just pull two chicks real quick.
Whatever you wanna do, bro.
I'm feeling a little better right now.
And I decide to go to Aztec, and maybe develop some seaside momentum.
Ready? You made it out! I guess we just wait for the hot girls to come.
Yeah.
Tonight I need to get Vinny a girl to cheer him up, 'cause that'll get him out of his funk, I know it.
But um It's a war out there.
There's a lotta grenades.
Oh, boy.
Ew, what the hell? She's battling you! She's battling you! Oh, my God.
I'm [Bleep] going home, bro.
I swear to God.
Push them away from me.
I was only gonna stay in Aztec if it's really good, and Aztec is just not good.
Grenades everywhere, and just not worth it if you're not feeling like being in a bar right now.
We're gonna leave.
Oh, really? - Yeah.
Did you wanna get her number first? No? I'm gonna wait over there.
Vin's in a funk since our surprise party, and I feel bad for him.
Like, I don't want anybody in a funk.
Because their funk puts me in a funk because they're in a funk, and I don't want anybody to be in a funk.
Is Vinny okay? He's tired.
My man Vinny's not feeling it, so bros before hos.
That's my boy, so I'm gonna leave with him.
Why you look so mad? I'm like, literally, bro, running on "e", and like, if it was worth it, I would've stayed, but Wanna go back home? - Yeah.
I would just try to get some sleep tonight.
Wanna do that? Sleep tonight, sleep tomorrow night At this point, like, I'm really in a weird place.
I'm sad, I'm anxious, I'm stressed, I'm hyper, I'm tired, and I need sleep.
Your car can only get so far on fumes, you know.
Mike, do you want a shot or no? Whatever you want.
I see Jionni at the bar, and right away, he's like, "Mike, lemme get you a drink.
" And I'm like, "all right, cool.
I'll take a drink.
" Cheers.
Next thing you know it, like, he's buying me drinks all night.
"Mike, you want a drink?" "Sure.
" "Mike, you want a shot?" "Sure, okay.
" And I'm thinking in the back of my head, like, wow, dude.
Like, if you only knew.
If you only knew it, but he's being so nice right now.
I like my man right here.
I like you, kid.
Mike's a nice guy.
- Huh? Mike's nice to me.
It's really weird to see Mike, like, buddy buddy with Jionni because last night he tried to break me and Jionni up.
You think Mike's nice, but it's just not real.
I've met him twice, he came up to me.
He goes, "bro, you're the nicest guy I've ever met.
" Why does everyone say that to you? You're not that nice.
I swear to God, he said it twice.
Watch my back with Mike and you.
Why? He's gonna try and, like, be shady.
To me? I can't sleep.
I'm just tired, and depleted, and exhausted, and I'm starting not to think rationally.
'Sup, dude? Vinny just, like, walked out the room.
Like, for Vinny to do that, and not say anything it's not good at all.
Like, all right, lemme go up there and talk to him, and see what I can do.
You all right? No.
What's wrong? - I can't sleep.
Come upstairs.
My man Vinny is acting real, real, real weird.
He's got some anxiety, um, and seeing the family kind of sparked it a little bit.
So he's in this crazy funk.
My brain just doesn't work anymore, dude, I can't think, I can't [Bleep], I can't sleep.
You know, I'm exhausted.
I have nothing left in me.
I'm homesick, you know what I'm saying? It's [Bleep] with me.
I can't do it.
Just try to get through the weekend.
Like, maybe going out, listening to music, being around girls.
You got work tomorrow, and that's bro, I can't [Bleep] function in this environment.
I [Bleep] Can't.
Relax, bro.
I don't give a [Bleep], bro.
Relax, dude.
You're spazzing out right now, relax.
I'm suffering, dude.
I've never seen Vinny like this.
To this level, like, I seen him homesick before, but I never seen him this bad.
I'm worried for Vinny.
I don't know what else to do to get Vinny out of this funk.
You're making it worse, yo.
Over-thinking everything.
Just - I'm about to bounce, bro.
Nah, I think that's - That's a bad decision, bro.
Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.
This is starting to get crazy.
I'm like, how do I talk this kid off the ledge? Because I know right now he wants to jump.
I got nothing left to give, man.
I wanna go home.
Here we go, Jersey! - Yeah! - I'm gonna throw up.
I am so excited to be home.
I'm like a hamster in heat.
Surprise! What the? - I love you, pal.
- Oh, my God! Hopefully this means I've been given a second chance with Jionni.
I don't know, like, whether to be happy or sad, I I - Why? - Well, I was already spinning, emotionally, and seeing my family just puts the washing machine on overload.
Oh.
Welcome home, buddy.
- get crazy Dj Pauly Delvecchio I'm goin' to Jersey Shore, bitch! All right, we got a situation.
Get crazy I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
After I have sex with a guy, I will rip their heads off.
Go, Vinny! Go, Vinny! You like the boobs? Do something crazy yeah! I have anxiety, like, bad.
My brain just doesn't work anymore, dude, I can't sleep.
You know, I'm exhausted, I have nothing left in me.
Try to get through the weekend.
Like, maybe going out, listening to music, being around girls You gotta work tomorrow, I'm not messing.
Bro, I can't function in this environment.
I want to go home.
Relax, bro.
I'm definitely not feeling like myself right now.
I am really, really anxious.
I'm suffering, dude.
Relax, man.
You're making it worse, you know? You're building it up in your head.
No, I'm seriously thinking about leaving.
No, I think that's That's a bad decision, bro.
Yeah I don't think that's a good idea.
I I got nothing left to give, man.
This is starting to get crazy.
How do I talk this kid off the ledge, because I know right now he wants to jump.
You can't go home, bro.
I would just try to get to some sleep tonight, because the weekend, I think you'll be fine once you get to the club with some chicks and thi - Yeah.
- I think.
- You know what I'm saying? - Chillax, bro, you gotta You know? At this point, like, I'm starting not to think rationally.
I'm burnt out, I'm pushing through, but the car can only get so far on fumes, you know? Mike! Ah, what's up, baby? How are you? Paula, Paula, Paula.
Well, me and Paula, we go way back.
I'm gonna wake you up.
I had met Paula the first summer in new Jersey.
- They're having sex.
- Are they? We were in the jacuzzi together, and I think Paula may have fell down the stairs, as well.
Paula's looking smoking right now, okay? And not to be disrespectful, she's a sweet girl, but let's be honest, it's a sure thing.
Let's just get out of here.
So we're gonna go back to the house and we'll see what happens from there.
We gotta go.
Are you ready? Go.
All of a sudden, thunder, lightning, pouring.
Oh, my God! Everybody's running for their lives right now.
Oh, my God! Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew! It's right here, it's right here, it's right Oh, my God.
- I'm soaked.
- Really? - Everybody gets t-shirts and shorts.
You guys wanted to leave.
I hate rain.
Do you have a shirt for me? Oh, I thought you brought some.
- It's in my car.
- Oh, man.
Then we get home.
We're all soaking wet, and Jionni has literally, like, nothing to wear.
Mike, can Jionni have a shirt? - What? - Can Jionni have a shirt? Sure.
I'm like, yeah, I mean, we share girls, why can't we share underwear, I mean, you know what I mean? - That's okay? - Whatever you want.
- I can take that? - Yeah, that's all you need? - Yeah, he just needs a shirt.
- Underwear? No, just a shirt.
Mike has cooties, so the fact that my man is wearing Mike's clothes, it's just like, "oh, I hope they're clean.
" You need underwear? Underwears, too? - Thanks, Mike.
- Mm-hmm.
What? We're gonna have to find something to cook in this mother , I can tell you that.
- Like, we're eating.
- We got eggs, sandwich roast beef, we got that.
Roast beef.
- All right.
- I'll cook.
You gave me clothes, I'll cook.
It's the least I can do.
All right, all right, whatever you want.
It's very ironic that, uh, Jionni's borrowing my clothes and cooking in the kitchen right now for me, and Nicole is just sitting right there.
Now, that's a situation.
Snooki, you hungry? I'm just gonna sit and watch.
How do you like your eggs, scrambled? Uh, how whatever, you know what I mean? If we had cheese it'd be great, but - We don't have cheese? - We've got the I think we got buns, though.
Jiminy cricket, I didn't know this was gonna be like a cook festival with, you know, Jionni and Mike.
Like, they're acting like they're best friends and I'm paranoid, 'cause I feel like Mike is gonna do something stupid.
Where are you going? I'm not hungry.
Nicole.
Just make you and her, I'm not gonna eat.
- No? - No.
- Eat, dude, eat something.
- No, no, no, I'm good, I swear.
I'll eat tomorrow.
Snooki just wanted to get him away from me as soon as possible, so she throws a tantrum, runs upstairs, and he runs away from his food.
But, uh, Jionni's hungry right now.
He wants to eat this sandwich.
He wouldn't be cooking if he wasn't.
What the? So I'll bring the food to you, mother.
No.
Snook, are you in there? Come on.
Really? Thanks, Mike.
I am the master of deception, and I can act like anybody's best friend.
All it is you gotta know how to play chess.
If you don't know how to play chess, maybe drop down and try checkers.
I'm so nice.
This is really good.
Ah! I burnt my whole face off.
It peeled, and then I exfoliated, and then burnt the part that I peeled.
Pauly D problems.
You're gonna stay always, right? I might have to make the best decision for myself, you know? I don't want to you to leave.
Bye, sweetie.
Call me soon.
- Ah.
- What the heck? Pauly likes to come into my room when I'm sleeping and tickle my feet and scream, "oh, yeah.
" So I just sneak up and I cuddle with him.
I probably shouldn't-a did that in front of vin, I think vin got a little mad, because that's his bitch.
You can't walk in my bed, have your way with me, and leave me.
And just leave you there? - When I'm not done.
- And not even call you a cab.
I never felt so violated in my life.
I'll buy you breakfast.
Gym, tanning, laundry.
It's just me, you, and Mike today.
Vin doesn't feel good.
It's time for work.
I don't know where the boys are.
Maybe Vinny's meeting us.
I'm so tired.
I am happy to work back at the shore store.
As long as I'm doing something I love, I have a great time.
Morning, girls, how are we doing? Morning.
Where's the third amigo? I have no idea, but he's going through a lot of issues and problems.
He's never late for a shift in three two summers.
Something really bad's going on.
That really screws you girls over, 'cause you're lifting the gates then.
- Uh, no.
- Come on.
- You should be mad at vin.
- Why don't you lift? Oh, man, vin.
Come on, vin.
Go.
How much are these things? - Hello? - Hey, poot.
What's going on? I miss you.
What, uh, what are you doing tonight? Going to karma.
- Are you pre-gaming at your house? Um, probably.
We're gonna take, like, a couple shots.
Oh, boy.
Could you not drink, please? Jionni's like, "don't drink so much, don't black out.
" I can't even, like, get drunk with my roommates.
I don't want you falling over.
All right, I get it.
All right, call me later.
He just needs to respect who I am.
Bye.
Oh.
Do you want to pay together? - My shift starts now, right? 12:30.
You've gotten on executive hours, big shot? Vin, how are you? - I'm okay.
- Are you okay? - Yeah.
What's up, bro? 12:30, right? No, what's up, dude? I feel that work will help me kind of get out of my own issues.
Wow, it's been a while.
Let's see if I still got it.
It's been a long time.
I'm actually helping, you know what I mean? I'm not sitting there, dwelling on my own , which makes it worse.
Ooh, still got it.
- Still got it.
- Still got it.
If I can get through this, you can get through this, you know? People think that you know, when it's not, uh, physical, that It's mental, I understand.
Yeah, but mental is just as bad as physical, you know what I'm It's worse.
Have Have you eaten yet, man? Have you had anything to eat? Um, I had a little bar this morning, I'm all right.
Why don't you come with me, bud? Yeah, cool.
Sammi, you're working the presses.
I'll get a drink or something.
I got it, I can handle it.
Thank you.
So what's going on, dude? I'll explain it all to you, bro.
Oh, really? I kind of want to explain to Danny what's happening.
Oh, yeah, I used to eat here.
I am maturing, and I'm not afraid to talk about my anxiety.
Let's chill out, dude.
What really What's really going on? I have, um, anxiety, I have, like, clinical anxiety.
- You just got it? - No, I've had it since I'm like - Oh, really? - Yeah.
It's either two ways, it's either like I get it and then I kind of I pull myself back at bay, you know what I mean? I just have little episodes, and like, I just had to breathe, and Is that like loss of breath and all that kind of stuff? Yeah, like a real attack, like, you know, just totally disconnected and, you know what I mean, like, whatever, I've had them a million times in my life, and those are easy, those are, like, simple.
And then what happens is, if, like, I become in a different stressful situation, I get so many that it kind of puts me in, like, a funk, you know what I mean? Really? Like, more of, like, a depressed state, yeah.
- Uh - I've been going through that since I left Italy, and on top of it I couldn't sleep.
I'm hoping now to develop some Like I said, positive momentum, and to just keep the wheels rolling, you know what I'm saying, and live in the moment, not think about anything.
Go out tonight, have some drinks.
Yeah.
Let me hit on your girlfriend and I'll be good.
All right, man.
It is a necessary thing to do.
If you're having these problems, it is important to talk to people around you and let them know what's going on.
It helps you and it's better for them, too.
- You guys got a close-knit group of friends.
It's true, but when you feel like it, bro, it totally disconnects you from the whole world.
See you tomorrow.
Vin, are you coming? I didn't even put underwear on today.
Oh, my God.
Gym, tan, nails? Laundry, tanning - Gym.
- Gym.
Oh, there's my boyfriend.
This whole bag's yours.
I had to get some aloe, 'cause my face is peeling off.
Wrong with that? Burn relief gel.
What are you doing now? Waiting for you.
What do you want to do? I'll give you that pedicure.
- Really? - Yeah.
Nice.
We're gonna have a guys' day today.
We're going to get mani/pedis, br.
You know, guy stuff.
- Do the nail thingy? - Yeah, buddy.
I'm doing everything to cater to Vinny a little bit.
Going the extra step, going the extra mile, just to keep his spirits up.
It's hard being a guy.
I got spray tan on my nails, and.
I'm trying to get a happy ending.
This is funny, right here.
You give me a mani/pedi.
- Mani/pedis? - Come over here.
For a guy one.
- Yeah, nice and hot.
- All right.
It's real hot? Yeah, yeah.
Uhh UhhUh, uh, uh.
As the guys try to help me get through what I'm going through, you know, it definitely doesn't fix the problem, but it gets me able to physically deal with my problem.
Can you put Vinny's name on my fingernail? Sure, you want a heart, too? That really shows how committed you are to me now.
You know what I mean? You get this done before? What'd he say? It feels weird.
What, did she go get the belt sander? Dude, she going she's getting the Jigsaw out, buddy.
Right now, like, I'm in a good place, and, you know, I want to be with my roommates and have this experience.
My legs feel good after that.
This is not a good time.
Ow! Ow.
I got no tan in Italy, so I got a little excited.
I went tanning in Jersey, went tanning, went tanning, went tanning, went tanning.
I burnt my whole face off.
Oh, it feels good in the air conditioning.
This is the best.
What the hell am I supposed to do? Yo, somebody help me! I burned my face off.
What'd you do? Tanning? - Oh, you peeled it.
- So it peeled, and then I exfoliated, and then burnt the part that I peeled.
Pauly D problems.
I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would tell anybody in this house to stop tanning.
- Does it hurt? - I can't see - I can't move my face.
- Oh, my God.
That's when you know the world is coming to an end.
You need cocoa butter.
No more tanning.
Our G.
T.
L.
Endurance is not up.
That's probably what it is.
I shocked the system, bro.
Yeah.
This really is white boy problems.
Hey, can we go back home? Snooki is snooki right now and Jionni's freaking out.
What? You're like pulling me.
Where's my chain? What the hell goes on in this house? People want to get down with you - Is that Ron-Ron juice? We're going to karma.
We're going to karma tonight, and I can't frickin' wait! Whoo! Finally.
Listen, I'm just gonna say this, even though you're a little off your "a" game, you're still gonna bring back And probably have sex tonight, I'm just saying.
You made me feel better.
Let's be real, Pauly.
Wow, you look really good.
- Would you bang me? - Bent over and sideways.
Okay.
It's important to look your hottest the first night of karma.
Just because if you don't look hot the first night of karma, karma will get you.
I want to put my Jionni underwear on.
And the fact that Jionni's gonna be there, I need to do stuff, you know, to make myself look good.
Oh, my God.
Cool! Jenni! Yeah? Look! That's what you wanted to show me? Don't show your ass to everybody.
Isn't that how it happened? What? Didn't you, like, flash everyone your ass? And? Jionni left.
Where's my boyfriend? Oh, maybe I should take these off, then.
- Yeah, good idea.
- Yeah.
I definitely would've done that.
Ugh, I don't know who I'm gonna get with, but it's gonna be someone good.
I can't do sex.
You could have sex.
I'm not gonna try out sex until I, like, have a boyfriend.
I'm about to go take a shot, 'cause I'm really excited.
If you want to join I'm actually thinking about not drinking tonight.
Just kidding! Uh, yes my vagina keeps.
I'm wearing my favorite necklace, my favorite watch.
Fresh to death for a "t" for karma.
Uh first karma! We're back in seaside.
Whoo! I don't think karma's ready for us.
We've been deprived of this for so long, that we're gonna go extra-hard tonight.
Just take one shot oh, my God, I see karma! Whoo! This is what I've been waiting for! Right here, right now what's up, buddy? Yeah! So we're back at karma, kids.
Right here, right now I'm really home, like, this is my home.
It's like an overwhelming feeling that I can't explain.
It's like love.
My first Jersey turnpike in Jersey! I finally feel back in my element.
Do you remember me? Oh, my God! Damian! I hit you up all the time.
Come here! All of a sudden my friend Damian comes up to me.
Come on.
We used to hook up back in the day, and I'm just like, "oh, my God," like he still looks hot.
Can I kiss you? Kiss me? Yeah.
Damian is in the right place at the right time.
Maybe he'll get the golden ticket.
My own so far away Oh, my boob! Babe, get down.
Oh, my God, I was gonna like cook you, like, chicken cutlets and stuff like that.
- What? - I'm over it.
What are you talking about? What chicken cutlets? Oh, my God.
Snooki is snooki right now, and she's abducted, and she's completely wasted.
Babe, can we go back home? I wanna go And I think Jionni's freaking out.
Ooh, I just fell.
Enough's enough, come on.
This is your girlfriend, Jionni, you know? I wanna go back.
You're such a idiot.
We're gonna leave in a little while.
All right.
Yo.
Snooki is wasted off her face.
I can't control her.
Go.
That's your girl.
And Jionni's definitely pissed, because he has to babysit Nicole.
Babe, your whole ass is out.
Fine, so let's go.
It's not like you're with your girlfriend, it's like you're taking care of your child, and you don't want to do that with your girlfriend.
Relax! You're like pulling me.
What's your name? Chantal.
Nice to meet you.
Chantal is the definition of D.
T.
F.
She's like so D.
T.
F.
Right now it's not even funny.
I'm ready to leave.
All right, let's go.
She literally wants to leave before I do.
Where's Vinny? Yeah, he's walking around by himself.
I just know Vinny.
Like, when he's in a good mood, he stays with the crowd.
When he's in a mood he kind of just does his own thing and like falls back and walks by himself.
Where are you going? - I'm gonna leave soon.
- Huh? I'm gonna leave soon.
Oh.
Alone? You know, I'm trying to make the best of it, but going to a loud, crazy club is not the best thing to do when you're having anxiety.
Let's go.
Want me to find you a girl? No, no, no, no, no.
Don't worry about it.
I'm leaving with no girl.
I was getting pissed, and I was like, "wow, this might happen right now.
" Are you okay? It was almost like Joe Montana, in the fourth quarter, I throw the pass, Paula catches it.
Aw, poor Mike.
And guess what? I come home with a girl.
I don't even I can't see, I'm so drunk.
Open the door, idiot.
Oops.
Ooh, it's sexy.
Come on.
Finally home.
Yo, these are my rims.
They 22s, son.
Just kidding.
That's called semen.
There's no semen.
- What is it? - It's not semen.
I want to lay you on the bed and do you.
I don't use the smoosh room, but Vinny's like, "can you use the smoosh room?" Because he wanted to get some sleep, and, um, I'm gonna cater to Vinny, 'cause I've been doing whatever it takes to get Vinny out of this funk, so I'm just trying to make him happy, I guess.
Baby, I'm your love child I'm your love child awesome.
I'm your love child my chain means the world to me.
Trying to think, I don't remember where I put it.
She stole it.
I'm thinking the girl that you brought home last night stole your chain, obvi.
She probably stuffed it in her ass.
I would do that.
Smooshing was good, but it's time for Chantal to leave and I gotta call her a cab.
Hey, here's my underwear.
Wait, I think.
This girl has to leave.
I'm gonna eat Turkey.
All right.
- Hello? - Hello.
- Yes, hi.
- Hi.
I would like a cab, please.
Where are you? I am in seaside heights, new Jersey state.
We ain't gonna have nobody down there for about Probably about an hour.
Are you kidding me? No.
I don't have an hour.
- Oh, well.
- She's gonna die.
I'm like, it's 4:00 in the morning, how many cabs could be out right now? I don't know if this girl wants to hang around, but I definitely don't want her to hang around.
We have to go.
I can't find my shoes, though.
I just got punked.
Hold on.
I'm serious, yo, like, they're new shoes.
I have like a million shoes.
I gotta get some sleep.
I want to get it in, get her out, call the cab.
They know the deal.
Like, who wants to spend the night? The cab's here.
- Cab - Cabs are here! Cabs are here? Cabs are here.
Cab's here.
Find my shoes? They're in the cab.
What? - They're not in the cab.
- Bye, babe.
Bye.
Adios.
I'll call you.
- Thanks for last night.
- Mm-hmm.
Love you.
Okay, love you.
Where's my chain? Is this clean? Trying to think.
I don't remember.
My chain means the world to me.
I don't remember where I put it.
- She stole it.
- Maybe.
She's selling it on eBay.
I need to find my diamond chain.
Yo, I don't know where I put my chain, I lost it.
Me, your diamond chain? Yeah.
- Come on, bro.
- Swear to God.
You better find that , bro.
Weird.
Check everywhere, bro.
I'm flipping out, trying to retrace my steps.
I'm telling you, she took it.
I'm thinking, you know, the girl that you brought home last night stole your chain, obvi.
Yeah, but she left with nothing, I seen.
She probably stuffed it in her ass.
Maybe.
Well, it's not under the bed.
I don't know what happened to my diamond chain.
I don't know if this girl stole it, if I gave it to her, if I put it on her, but it's missing and it's my favorite gold chain.
What the hell goes on in this house? Hmm.
I'm tired.
I don't want to go to the club, you know what I mean? Like every night.
I could just see it in vin's face that he's, like, at that breaking point.
I'm dwelling in my problem.
That's not making it better.
You know, I can't find my chain.
I'm trying to think, I don't remember where I put it.
It's nowhere to be found.
It's definitely not in here.
My sneakers were still in there, my sunglasses were still in there.
Oh, my God, it's the from last night.
Maybe she has it.
- Yeah, she got it.
- She got it? - What's up, babe? - Hey.
How are you? Good, how are you? What the hell? I see my diamond chain glistening in the sun, like looking all perfect.
I'm like, "phew!" Thank God.
Holy! Yo, we was like Ripped the whole house apart.
- I - I had your I.
D.
, I'm like, honestly, I woke up this morning, and I'm like, "oh, what do I have?" Oh, my God.
Congratulations.
So I was like, "I I can't keep that.
" She's like all happy, like, "oh, yeah, I forgot" to give you this back.
" I'm like, "you got to be kidding me!" - And - Yeah, where are you going, out to the beach? I want my shoes.
- Where are they? - I don't know.
Let's find them.
- This is what I get for going into the nasty-ass smoosh room, like, I'll never go in the smoosh room again.
The funniest thing just happened.
What? We get a knock at the door, it's the girl from last night, and she's wearing the chain.
Shut up.
She's upstairs right now with him.
I feel like the girl just took Pauly's chain so the next day she can come back and see Pauly again, and probably try and smash.
- Like this? - No.
I would do that.
When did you take them off? - I don't know.
- Neither do I.
We're looking around and they are nowhere to be found.
So she lost her dignity, her self-respect, so what the hell you need shoes for? If I find the shoes, I'll call you.
They're black with wood heels.
So I'm now coming up with a new plan.
Whenever a girl leaves the house, I'm going to hug her and then pat her down at the same exact time.
- the hell? - Well? I'm not drinking, for the rest of my life.
Till tonight.
Ready? We have two minutes to get to work? Anybody here? Hello? Anybody home? I'm definitely not feeling like myself right now.
I am really, really anxious, and the anxiety has pretty much overcome, you know, my entire being here.
Anybody home? - Vin? - Yeah.
You all right? Yeah.
Want to do something? Go down to the boardwalk? Rides? Pushing Not rides or pushing games.
Yeah.
Win some , vin.
How are you feeling today, good? I feel.
Sort of like every other day.
With vin it's like I love the kid.
He's been my friend since day one in this house.
Want to go on the Ferris wheel and make out? Him going through stuff, it, like, it hurts me, because I don't want to see him like that, and I feel like he can snap out of it, or, like, you can get through it.
Oh! - Oh, hey! - Yeah! There goes another big one.
Can I touch it? I really appreciate Ronnie trying to cheer me up, but I'm like a little bit beyond that point right now.
I'm tired.
I don't want to go to the club, you know what I mean, like every night, you know what I'm saying? - You do or you don't? - I don't.
The thing, too, is that I'm dwelling in my problems.
You know what I'm saying? Like, that's not making it better, like, you know.
I need, um, rest.
You know what I'm saying? Not like sleep rest, I need, like, rest.
I can just see it in vin's face that he's like at that breaking point.
You know, like, I can see it in him.
Like, what do you do if you don't want to go out to a club? You know what I mean? A lot of things that are happening here are triggering my anxiety problems.
Not being able to sleep, all the partying, all the staying up, all the loudness, and it's a pretty scary feeling.
Summer's turned its back and left for good I have a choice, either not react to the craziness that happens around me I gave up drinking.
Drinking's just not good for me.
Or remove myself.
Either way, I have a choice.
'Cause this is where I am in a lonesome river town Nicole? You don't want to talk real quick? I keep trying to think what it is that he needs.
Are you sure this is what you want to do? Oh, my God.
- Where'd you go? - Down to the boardwalk.
Got you a bulldog.
Here.
Aw.
What you doing? Nothing.
Are you sad again? Yeah.
You're gonna stay always, right? I don't know.
What do you feel? Anxious.
Not myself, you know? You gonna drink tonight, or no? No, I'm not drinking at all anymore.
I'm not in the state of mind to be drinking.
Yeah, I get it.
For my own selfish ways I don't want Vinny to leave.
I'm like, "just stick it out, come on.
" But then again, you have to think of Vinny, like, how he's feeling, and if he's not comfortable, he needs to go.
Well, I don't want you to leave.
I know.
I'm sure nobody does, but - Mm-mm.
I might have to make the best decision for myself, you know? I know that my roommates are gonna make it hard on me to leave, but ultimately, this is my decision, and I need to take care of myself.
I just don't want it to be best for you now, and then two weeks from now you're like at home, right back in the same spot because of the choice you made.
Like, if I make the decision to go, like - No.
- I want to do it from, like, a calm state of mind, like right now, you know what I mean? I don't want to do it, like, where I can't sleep, and I'm not thinking rationally and I'm flipping out.
At the end of the day, you have to be happy.
Right, that's the best advice anyone's ever gave me since I've been here.
Hello? Hello? Hi.
What club are we going to tonight? - Karma.
- Okay.
- Vinny's sad again.
- Yeah, I know.
- Why? - He's thinking if he wants to leave or not.
No.
Like, he doesn't want to drink anymore, so he's like Why? 'Cause he said that people look towards that to, like, fix their problems, and he doesn't want to do that.
Sure.
Vinny is really sad, so usually when one of your roommates is, like, depressed, it kind of rubs off on all of us.
So it's like Dude, if he leave, this house is never gonna be the same.
We're gonna be so upset.
I'm gonna be so upset if he leaves.
And Pauly.
I'm not gonna drink at the club.
Ah, ha, ha, ha! Doing eyelashes when you're buzzed is not a good time.
- Is your face better? - Yeah.
It got better.
Cool.
Did it hurt when you made out with that girl last night? - Yeah.
- It did? - Uh-huh.
- Oh, , was she like Yeah.
You play, you know your part Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh, I say hey yeah, and I ooh should we still go out? I'm gonna wait.
Should we all wait? I don't want to bombard him.
With the million people here.
But I don't know what to do, should I keep like, I don't - Uh, me neither.
- I don't know what to do.
With vin it's like when you smother him, he fights back, but when you give him his space, he'll come to you.
It just makes it worse by us staying home, you know what I mean? Like, like if he needs his space, that's understandable.
- We can't all stay here and bum-rush him, it's gonna make it worse.
Yeah, no we gotta We just can't, it's just It's not gonna be good.
He's gonna he's gonna walk out the house.
I know.
I want to stay, but I feel like you need to talk to him, because if yeah, you put too many people around him No, just Pauly.
I don't want to be the reason that he leaves 'cause he feels overwhelmed.
In fact, we need to get out of this house and let them talk.
Yes.
Let's go, and I'm gonna talk to him then.
I can meet yous guys later or whatever.
I don't want to see Vinny leave, and I'm just hoping and praying maybe Pauly can, like, knock some sense into him.
Let Pauly do his thing.
That's what I was thinking the other night, you know what I mean? Love you, Pauly.
Love you, too.
- Love you.
- Love you, too.
If you can make it out later Who are you calling? My sister.
- Hello? - Hi.
I want you to come get me.
- You do? - Mm-hmm.
I've been strong, you know what I mean? Like, I'm a fighter.
But there's no fight left in me.
So I make the decision that I'm gonna leave here.
You don't want to talk real quick? Are you sure this is what you want to do? Okay, are you positive? - Mm-hmm.
All right.
I really don't understand what Vinny's going through, and it frustrates me, because I keep trying to think what it is that he needs.
I'll just get a cab sent out.
I think it'll be quicker that way.
All right.
- All right, bye.
- Bye.
Why do you want leave, man? - I have to, bro.
- Well, what now, what Dude, don't make it a big thing, please.
I'm not trying to make it a big thing, I just want to know why.
It's best for me, you know what I mean? I need to I need to get myself better.
Every day I'm suffering.
You're a smart kid, you give everybody in this house advice.
I know, I know.
I you sure this is what you want to do? Yeah, bro.
I'm not happy, you know what I mean? Like, I'm doing what's best for myself, and that's it.
Stay for me, man.
Why do you want leave, man? I have to, bro.
Don't make it a big thing.
You you sure this is what you want to do? Yeah, bro.
I'm not myself, I'm not I can't get better here.
I'm not happy, you know what I mean? Like, I'm doing what's best for myself.
Help me pack? I need to get better deep down inside, and the options are just not really available to me here.
I need to go recover at home.
You're not gonna pack everything.
- Yeah, kid, I'm gonna pack.
- You'll be back tomorrow.
Stop.
There's nothing else in my power I can do to make him happy.
Will you write? Will I write? So I will let him fix himself, because I've tried everything.
Could we sext? Are we separated already? Let's go inside.
Karma is crowded and full of a lot of people, and we don't have Vinny.
It's weird.
So we're like, "let's just try and really enjoy each other" and stay together as a group.
" - Love you all! - Yeah, cheers.
Whoo! - You all right? - Hi, babe.
Should I go with you? Come.
So you know you have to come back? You're gonna leave me with the situation? That's your cousin.
Trust me, bro, the hardest part is leaving you, you know? I mean that, and you, as my friend, I want you to understand that.
I know.
You know, this is best for me.
It's hard to look at Pauly's face right now, because, you know, I've never seen him this upset, and I feel the worst, leaving Pauly, but at the same time, I think Pauly truly does care about me, like as a family member, and if your family member is in need of something, then you've gotta completely understand.
You gonna need shirts? Nah, I'm good, I got so many shirts.
Thanks, though.
This is the weirdest thing I've ever had to do in my whole entire life, to help my man pack, because I don't want him to leave, but yet I'm helping him pack.
I'm so exhausted right now.
It is messing with me, and I'm like, "damn, like, it's it's real, this is a reality right here.
" Bags, bags, bags, bags, bags, bags, bags.
so please don't be offended - Got it? - Thanks a lot.
It's just the state of mind I'm in today on my way oh I'm gonna miss, you know, just the fun times I had at the shore house.
Not gonna be the same without you, you know that? This is a fun place to be if you're feeling in a good mood.
All right, brother.
Love you.
I love you, too, man.
- Clear your head.
- I will.
- Call me.
- I will.
I just want to grab onto my dude and just and be like, "don't go, don't go, don't leave me.
" But please don't be offended it's just I'm feeling like I'm on my way oh on my way there's so much going on in my head right now.
Like, was there something else I could've done for him not to leave? It sucks, like, what do I do now? Oh, on my way oh - I had to come home.
- Yeah? Okay.
That's good.
Let's celebrate for vin today.
Hang on, you're whoa! I'm gonna have to cut my hair.
Are you kidding me? There was like a beehive in Deena's head.
We had a problem! It's my birthday, Pauly's birthday.
I'm pretty sure they didn't give a about me.
Thank you for the cake.
We made a cake for Pauly and not Mike.
That's what you get for being a douche bag.
It actually hurts me that people don't care.
All right, unit.
Get real, bitch.
Unit is the witness to myself and Snooki getting down while she's been with Jionni.
Do you want me to tell you about yourself No, stop.
I don't trust Mike and the unit.
They're trying to this relationship up.
You're a loser.
If you didn't have Mike, you'd be a loser.
It's only a matter of time - before the truth's coming out.
- Oh, God.
- Why do you want to leave now? - I have to, bro.
I just want to grab onto my dude and be like, "don't go, don't go, don't leave me.
" - All right, man.
- Okay, man.
It sucks.
Like what do I do now? Dj Pauly Delvecchio! I'm going to the Jersey Shore, bitch! All right, we got a situation.
I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
After I have sex with a guy I will rip their heads off.
Go vinny! Go vinny! You like the boobs? If you wanna have fun and do something crazy - All right, we good to go? - Yeah.
So at this point my man leaves me.
I got to go tell the rest of the household that vinny may not be coming back.
- What happened? - He left.
- He took everything? - Yeah.
- For good? - Yeah.
Vinny left the house.
Oh, that was the last thing that I thought was going to happen.
Vinny is gone.
What's the matter? What's the matter? Vinny left.
Just tell me right now, do you love him? I love him as a roommate.
He's like one of my really good friends.
Vinny's gone.
Is he coming back? Did he take everything? Yep.
Not now.
- I love him.
- Deena overreacts about everything.
Deena's very dramatic with the waterworks.
So hearing that vinny stubbed his toe, she might have cried.
Oh, he was like my soul.
Deena, it's fine.
Regardless, it's going to be fine.
- I know, Jen.
- Let him fix himself.
- Listen - I'm being so selfish.
I'm being selfish.
Yeah, exactly.
- I know I am.
- You're being selfish.
I know I am.
I know I am.
I am drunk deena's mom right now.
And it is what it is.
I'm used to it.
- Can you fix me? - You're fine.
He was my rock.
I need to have a good time, Dee.
- I love vinny.
- Listen up.
We're gonna enjoy the night for him right now.
We have an hour left.
Let's just go enjoy the hour.
We're good.
Do I look like a mess? Yeah, you're mad cute.
Can we get a drink? I'm like a shopper at like, you know, at a store.
I see someone I like Okay, right there, come here.
You now come with me.
What are you guys doing tomorrow? Um, having breakfast with you.
Well, all right.
What do you like? French toast? We'll have French toast.
Are we leaving? I want to use the grenade hammer on the girl that situation brought home.
But I had to grab this cute girl to get it in for my man, vinny.
Well, aren't you pretty? Place is a mess? Not for me.
I didn't think vinny was that, like, serious about leaving.
I thought at least maybe he'd leave some stuff and then come back, like Sam did.
When I walked in and I saw everything gone, I was just like, "he's really gone.
Like he's gone.
" Hey.
He's not coming back, Jen.
Do you know any Italian? - Yes, a lot of it.
- Really? So if I say something to you, you'll understand it? - Most likely.
- Okay, - so.
- Eat something.
Oh, , she knows Italian.
- Wow.
- Okay,.
You can say it.
Yeah.
Uh, pecorina.
It's a type of cheese.
No, pecarina is.
- I had to come home.
- Yeah? Okay.
That's good.
That's good.
You all right? I had a lot of anxiety over there.
Okay.
I had to deal with it over here, you know? It wasn't the right environment for me to be in To deal with that.
It was too much.
All right.
Good, good.
Go to sleep now.
- Like why leave now? - Why this instant? I just miss kid.
Like, I don't want him to be gone.
I never thought he would really leave.
Let's celebrate for vin today.
Let's just get wastie pants.
You're good.
You'reWhoa! We got "situation nation" coming down tonight.
I'm hoping that nothing stupid is gonna go down.
When the unit's in the house, you never know.
Can I get a taxi to 1209 ocean terrace? Oh! Oh, tomorrow's sunday, monday and tuesday are birthdays.
This is really our birthday weekend, though.
- I know.
- Tonight's really the night.

Wah! All right, let's go.
On the count of three Jen! I'm really excited.

Meatball day! We're not going to remember it.
We're probably going to make out.
We're two meatballs.
Yay! Oh, my butt.
My butt shows.
Yeah, my are flapping out.
Haven't really had a meatball day in seaside yet.
So I feel like today should be a perfect meatball day.
Let's just get wastie pants.
Yay! Oh, my God, I'm gonna get in so much trouble.
Jionni's gonna kill me.
My sister! Joanie! Hey, how are you? I see my sister.
I'm like, "typical," like she would fricking be here.
" Mom's going to kill me for getting you drunk.
What's your name? I'm Chris.
Chris, I love you.
We met this awesome gay guy.
You're gay, right? Yeah.
I love gay men.
Love them! I can hang out with gay men all fricking day.
You can get fricking hammered, and you don't have to worry about giving them, like, a at the end of the night, and that's awesome.
I love to be a gay man's fly.
Whoo! Nicole is a little bit more drunk than I am.
I'm a little bit more like "merp," where Nicole is like "Merp.
" Can you walk at all? - I'm mad drunk right now.
- Can you walk at all? - Yes.
- Can you walk? So I'm taking care of her, Chris is taking care of her.
- I got you, babe.
- Yeah, dude, don't worry.
We got you, all right? You ain't going nowhere.
This is what I need.
I really hope she doesn't get fricking arrested again.
Hold my arm.
Hold my arm.
You know it's bad when I'm the sober one.
- Watch your foot.
- Pull up.
You're good.
You'reWhoa! I got you.
I got you.
This is all a knot.
I'm gonna have to cut my hair.
How the frick are you gonna to tell a guidette apart without their extensions? Ooh! Oh, listen.
Shh shh shh.
Oh, man, somebody get some shaving cream.
- Pauly's birthday cake - It may taste good, but it doesn't look good, and I'm upset right now.
You're good, you're Whoa! I got you.
Cab's right there.
You're all right, Nicole.
Let's go get me some vodka.
Or a little bit.
Now it's two meatballs on the loose, and we're completely not in the state of mind we should be.
Me and deena are at aztec.
I just feel like pushing these guys, I mean, like, get real.
Like, you're 12 years old, and you're trying to this bump rush.
Okay.
No, we're the veterans, and I'll show you how it's done.
At that point, and once we fell, I was like, there's no really coming back from this one.
We might as well just get going.
Yo, your ass is hanging out.
- Holy nipple slip! - Are you for real? What was you working tonight, girl? What corner was you working? This is not going to be pretty.
This is all a knot.
You must make old man humble.
Like, what is going on? Like, I'm going to have to cut my hair.
Shhh.
No, you don't have - to cut your hair.
- Relax.
I have to cut it.
- This your hair? - Yep.
- You feel that? - Mm-hmm.
Deena's hair is, like, disgusting right now, like a big fricking knot.
So you might as well go Britney Spears and shave your head, because she's screwed.
Why? Ooh! - Oh, dear , Pauly.
- Ugh! Are you kidding me? There was like a beehive in deena's head.
I don't know if this is my hair orNope.
Hold on.
Like did you fall? My hair? No, she just danced her ass off.
My identity is just tearing off of me at this point.
It's like fingerprints.
How the frick are you going to tell a guidette apart without their extensions? - This is pointless.
You gotta deep-condition.
Guidette problem! Crisis averted.
In memory of vinny, I'm rocking skinny jeans.
Right now, karma is bananas.
I look to my left, and I see my best friend jon, aka the unit.
The unit is the star witness of the crime between Snooki cheating on Jionni with myself.
And now that, you know, they're all in the same place, that's the ingredients for a situation.
I say we take this club over.
All these people 'round here.
And let's grab some real estate.
Let's go.
So the fact that Mike and the unit are together, now I'm on high alert.
I thought Mike was better with drama, but honestly, the unit is, like, ten times more worse.
We're just going to try and distance ourselves from the assholes.
Let's go dance.
Corner of my eye, I see this tattooed chick, and she, like, has vinny's name all over.
Like, a little bit older, and tatted from the head down.
I can just tell this girl's dtf.
You can smell it, see it, taste it.
She's DTF.
- Love the sneakers.
- Thank you.
My whole living room is full of my sneakers.
- Oh, really? - Yeah, you'll see.
I mean, this is mission accomplished, 100%.
Like she's ready to go.
And that's what's up.
No work involved.
Pauly, where are you going? - I'm going home.
Bye-bye.
I'm going to smash this tattooed chick in my man vinny's bed, in honor of my man vinny for leaving the house.
She's over there.
Right there.
Right to your left.
I'm, like, looking for Snooki right now, but she's 4'9".
I can't even find her.
Out there, in the corner, brother.
You know, myself and the unit are just gonna play a little game I call gym tan The truth will set you free.
Let's make this happen let's have some fun.
Whoo-hoo! It's about to go down right now.
Thank you for the cake.
We made a cake for Pauly and not Mike.
That's what you get for being a douche bag.
I'm tired of being the bad dude.
I don't know if I can do it anymore.
She's over there, right there.
Right to your left.
Myself and the unit are ready to gym, tan, tell the truth.
Let's make this happen.
Let's have some fun.
Unit's in front of me walking, and all of a sudden a fight broke out.
It was mayhem.
I can't even move right now.
I'm on the side of the fence right now.
Are they fighting? Are they fighting? Honestly, I don't care about drama.
I mean, as long as it doesn't concern me and Jionni, I'm fine.
And at this point, I just want to get in the sheets with Jionni.
I don't care about anything else but me and Jionni smushing.
If he got thrown out, he got thrown out.
We cannot let him come back in.
I find out that unit just got kicked out of the club.
And now I'm pissed as hell.
Rip off.
Are you kidding me, dog? You kidding me, dog? There's no difference with anybody else.
I didn't even get a chance.
Nicole is definitely not off the hook.
The summer just started.
Here's my room.
Um, I can't get it off.
This girl is vinny's type to a tee.
So I smashed her as a perfect way to honor vinny.
- Hello? Hi.
- Hi.
- How are you? - Fine.
How are you? - How's everything? - Good.
- How's the kids? - Fine.
They must be getting big now, huh? - Huh? - Can I have a cab? It was crazy last night.
I'm definitely a little tired.
And the last thing I want to do is work at the t-shirt shop right now.
Do you need any help? SheShe's right there.
No sleeping at work.
Oh, my God.
I've never You didn't tell us to get off break yet.
Break's 10, 15 minutes, not half an hour.
I always get stuck working with Mike and jenni all the time.
They don't do anything.
Like, they just stand there.
There are definitely some cute new chicks at the Shore store right now.
I have an incentive right now.
I work for incentives.
Yeah, I think it fits.
Yeah.
Mike! What would you like on them? What do you recommend? I'll just get it Maybe "situation.
" - Whatever you want.
- Yes.
So next time on the show, you should wear them.
Yeah? Okay.
I met this cutie, from Bosnia, I believe.
Now she's got "I love situation" Booty shorts.
I want grilled cheese.
Giving me her number right now, and telling me she wanted grilled cheese in the morning.
Don't worry.
In the morning.
With no crust.
I mean, that's just the truth right there.
You suckered me in.
I'm a sweetheart.
You're calling vin? Yeah, come in here.
Hello? - What's up, buddy? - What's up, my dude? How are you feeling? Feeling better, you know, day by day.
Um, sorry I didn't get to say good-bye to you guys.
No, it's cool.
We miss you though.
It's not the same without you here.
Vinny's been my friend since day one in this house, you know, and I love the kid, so it hurts me to see him like that.
- How was the weekend? - The weekend was good.
I smashed a girl in your honor in your bed.
She was a cougar with tattoos.
Ah, thank you.
I made her call me vinny and everything.
I think Pauly and Ron are having the most difficult time dealing with vinny not being here.
Sucks, like, that they're missing their best friend.
How are you doing, good? You fighting with your boyfriend or what? Everything's fine.
I just want you to come back.
I mean, even though I have a boyfriend, I'll always have that special place in my heart for vinny.
And the fact that he's not here, you know, who am I going to, you know, flirt with? Just talked to vinny.
Oh.
What'd he say? He's not coming back anytime soon.
That sucks.
Can we just talk in the room? - I have no time to talk to anybody at 4:00 in the morning.
I want to hang out with Mike then, if you're going to go to bed.
If she's not DTF to Pauly Like, really? You're DTF for Mike? Like, that's absurd.
- Surprise! - Could not believe my eyes.
Best gift I ever had in my life.
Guys, we're leaving! Wow, you just woke me the up.
Ooh! Somebody smells good.
Everybody's kind of down.
We miss vinny.
But it's about time to turn this around.
It's fricking my birthday.
Break out of your funk! - I'm fine.
- You go dance.
The scene at aztec It is crowded.
And all of a sudden, I look to my left, and I see this Bosnian girl from the Shore store.
She's actually, um I think she's kind of cute.
What are we cheering to? Grilled cheese, no crust.
- Snuggle naked.
- Snuggle naked? Yeah, that's always good.
I've been looking for you all day! Aw, hell, yeah.
I'm definitely excited to see Paula.
I guess you'd have to say that Paula is my main squeeze right now.
The body on that girl Ooh, sheesh! This Bosnian girl, she's flirting with me in the beginning of the night, and now I'm walking away from her to go to Paula.
I got to share sometimes, so I'm happy to pass the torch, Pauly, it's your birthday.
Happy birthday to you I'm a nice girl.
I'm European, remember? Where you from? - From Bosnia.
- All right.
I'm having a great time at aztec right now.
We're drinking, we're dancing.
It's just turning into a fabulous night.
I know you! My brother! So I see this Joey kid.
I flirted with his twin last year.
Do you want to kiss me? Yeah.
You're the cuter one, I feel.
I'm just like Typical.
Typical deena scenario.
This is my friend Joey.
He's coming home with me.
Okay.
I'm going to dial you up.
There you go.
Oh, ho, ho, yeah! Real nice, huh? Real nice.
You have such a cute smile.
No, stop it.
Now you're making me blush.
This Bosnian chick is so persistent.
I'm like, "this girl must want to do something.
" Yo, let's get outta here.
Yeah? Let's go.
My 31st birthday I need to get laid.
If this girl's going to try so hard to go out of her way to come out with me, I'll take her home.
My room's the cleanest place in the house.
Do yourself a favor Don't go anywhere in the house except my room.
Swear to God.
You'll see why.
I'll show you.
- You're single, right? - Yeah.
- No girlfriend? Oh.
- Nah.
So you're going to eat while I shower? - Yeah.
- Okay.
Have a good night.
So what kind of guy are you? - I'm a good guy.
- Are you? Even though, like, I look like I'm a nutcase, I'm actually a good girl.
Good night.
You can come to bed or I can call you a cab.
It's up to you.
Poor Pauly's about to go to bed and this girl looks like a lost puppy, like doesn't know what to do with herself.
Can we just talk in the room? I'll call the cab.
I have no time to talk to anybody at 4:00 in the morning.
It should be against the law to come to my house at 4:00 in the morning, on my birthday, and not give me birthday sex.
Can I have a cab? - 1209 ocean terrace? - Yep.
For one Bosnian.
- Excuse me? - One person.
- Oh, my God.
- What? Pauly's girl.
It's his birthday.
He needs to get it in What is this girl No, she's a.
No, she's not.
- Is she cool? - She's not DTF.
Oh, she's not? It was nice to meet you.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Good night.
Okay.
She seems like a nice girl though.
She is.
That's why she doesn't belong here.
- Exactly.
- No offense, Paula.
Hey.
Yeah, you're good.
Paula, you and Mike have, like, a relationship.
I think Mike likes Paula.
I don't know if maybe 'cause she's easy to bring home.
She's like a hippie.
Anything goes with Paula.
Like, she's a hippie.
But I think deep down Mike likes Paula.
He must like you if he keeps going back to the Paula.
You just do whatever you want.
That's why I like you, 'cause you're so, like, nonchalant about.
You just don't care.
Everything's fine.
When you care about things, then you get hurt.
- Yeah.
- I can't have that anymore.
Oh, no, girl.
You have a good attitude.
Keep it up.
I'll do my best.
I actually really like Paula.
She may be dirty and grimy and disgusting, but she's just a nice girl.
But we'll see what happens with Paula and Mike.
When you're done, just jump in the bed.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Can ICan I talk? Can I come inside? What's up? I don't want to go home yet.
What do you want to do? I want to hang out with Mike, then, if you're going to go to bed.
Go hang out with Mike.
He's busy though.
Who does this girl think she is, like, coming back into this house? And, I mean, if she's not DTF to Pauly Like, really? You're DTF for Mike? - Like, that's absurd.
- That's just crazy.
Let's just hang out.
Well I mean Is Paula still here? - Paula? - Yeah.
Where is she? Shower.
Is she really? So are you with Paula? I'm just curious.
She's not DTF? She definitely is, but we get along.
You know what I mean? Like, she's a cool chick, you know? So I guess.
I don't know, right? Maybe, uh Maybe we made the wrong choice.
Who knows, you know? Maybe we made the wrong choice.
I always like to keep my options open, but at the end of the day, I wasn't going to leave Paula.
You know what I'm saying? She's, like, AAA, you know? You call her, she's there.
- The girl came and left again.
- What girl? - Pauly's girl.
- Oh, she bounced? Again.
I'm being honest.
There definitely is a little room for Paula in this crazy heart of mine.
The "sitch" could get wifed up.
Who knows? You never know.
I mean, I'm not going to lie.
I actually would love a girlfriend, you know? And me and Paula have been hanging out a lot, and getting along very well.
So who knows? Happy birthday.
I mean, it's my birthday, Pauly's birthday.
And I'm like, "what about me?" Thank you for the cake.
It actually hurts me to think that people don't care.
Maybe I'm just jealous.
I don't know.
And we're down to six.
What? You want to call a cab? Okay.
Happy birthday.
Me and Paula, you know, our relationship is definitely good.
- Good-bye.
- Bye, sweetie.
But it didn't hit that step where we're boyfriend-girlfriend yet.
- You ready? - Not really.
Oh! So I wake up this morning.
It's officially my birthday.
I wish vinny was here.
Like, it's just not the same without vinny.
Open the door and then Surprise! I could not believe my eyes.
My mother brought all of Rhode island with her.
She brought both my aunt Paulas, my aunt Janice, my uncle George.
Um, big Jerry's there.
It's an unbelievable feeling to see my family right now on my birthday.
They literally brought my birthday to Jersey.
- Oh, yes.
- That's the hot tub.
The infamous hot tub.
I don't even want to touch it.
It is his birthday, right? And mama Dukes though, she's got a good present for you.
I want to give you one first right away, okay? There you go.
- It's an infamous hot tub.
- Yep.
- Look at my hair! - That's why I'm here.
Look at my hair! My mother pulled together and made it happen.
She brought my barber here to cut my hair for my birthday.
Best gift I ever had in my life.
- Hey, buddy! - Happy birthday! That's the best present I ever had! This is definitely the happiest that Pauly's been since vinny left.
New haircut, big Jerry's there, his family's there.
This is the best gift in the world.
Yeah, buddy.
I told you, ma.
It's been a while.
It's been a long time.
Smiling from cheek to cheek, all over a haircut.
He really loves his hair.
How long you been growing the hair for, Pauly? More than ten years.
I'll never forget when he first started that.
And then I'm like, "what are you doing with your head?" Why you put glue on your head? What is that? All right.
I'm going to do my hair now.
I love my mom and family, but my barber really made my birthday happen.
I'm back to being FTD Fresh to death.
I'm the freshest person in seaside again.
Wow, yeah.
What's the deal? I'm going to meet the fam at rivoli's for dinner.
You guys want to come? Yeah.
This is the first year that we're celebrating myself and Pauly's birthday all together, so it would have been nice for my family to come for a birthday dinner, but maybe next year.
I'm going to see you guys in a little bit, all right? All right.
So, like, are we still throwing a party? - Mm-hmm.
- We are? Me and you, we have to interview the strippers.
Me and the girls are planning a big surprise party for Pauly and Mike.
We definitely need at least two strippers to pull this party off.
This is going to be one for the books.
- We are on break? - Yeah.
You guys can go on break right now.
Go grab something to drink.
We have to call strippers.
We'll get hot ones and, like, one that's hot.
I mean, I know I'm not the smartest crayon in the box, but this isn't rocket scientists.
Like, we can make a party.
So what I'm thinking is we should call the pimp place or whatever.
That's prostitution.
- Yeah.
- That's, like, weird.
Oh, I don't know if it's called a pimp place.
- Just do a stripper club.
- It's like a stripper joint.
Try and get some nice Transsexuals.
Mike would be like, "oh, hey!" A new Jersey turnpike mate.
You know.
So we're going to have this huge dinner at rivoli's for my birthday.
I'm going to meet my whole family there.
Right now, the only thing missing to this dinner to make it perfect is my boy vinny.
Salud.
Happy birthday.
He's been dying to meet my family, dying to hang out with my family.
And it's my fricking birthday, and my best friend's not here.
I need a pitchfork and a shovel.
What do you do with this thing? - Told you.
- Wow.
That's ridiculous.
You're laughing.
Wait till you see your dish.
That's ridiculous.
The lobster's the size of Snooki.
What is going on? I'm, you know, definitely very agitated right now.
I mean, it's my birthday, Pauly's birthday, and I see Pauly smiling, and I'm like, "yo, what about me?" Excuse me, guys.
Mike's doing the fricking dip.
Mike dips out.
Where he goes, I have no idea.
Oh! Oh! I guess it's wishing you had something you don't.
Pauly's got his friends and family.
I feel like I have nobody.
I'm like a house with no legs right now.
Not sturdy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm glad you guys got to come down.
- Happy birthday.
- Yay, yay, yay.
Oh, yeah, that's good cake.
That was a good birthday.
Oh, listen.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Listen to that.
It's so loud.
I got to sleep with that.
Oh, man.
Somebody get some shaving cream.
Put some cake on him.
He sleeps like this.
I want to see.
I got to see that one.
Who sleeps through this? happy birthday to you I mean, it's my birthday, Pauly's birthday, and I see Pauly smiling, and I'm like, "yo, what about me?" Who's great idea was it to put cake on my face? Pauly's birthday cake It may taste good, but it doesn't look good.
And I'm upset right now.
This is legit right now.
I love cake decorating.
Pauly and the boys aren't home, so the meatballs decide to make the cake.
And I'm like, "I want to frost it.
" I want to make this cake look cute for Pauly's birthday.
Hey, Mike, we don't need help.
It's all right.
Mike's here? Oh, they're back.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Oh, of course.
The girls made, you know, Pauly's birthday cake.
I'm just like, "you know what? Like, I must be the devil in this house.
" Hey, who made that? We did! Wow, look at that haircut.
- Sam did the icing.
- That's sick.
Wow, that's dope.
You like? There's a good guy and a bad guy in the movie.
And in this house, there's a good guy and there's a bad guy.
So Pauly's the good guy and it seems like I'm the bad guy a lot of the times.
Thank you for the cake.
Of course.
I love you.
Thank you.
Love you too.
Well, obviously Mike knows that we all like Pauly better than him.
So the fact that we made a cake for Pauly and not Mike That's what you get for being a douche bag.
Ah.
My ass is, like, protruding.
- What? - Protruding.
Word of the day Use it.
In what context? Like, "my just protruded" 'cause I had sex.
" Come on.
Did you have a good birthday? Mmm.
Got your hair cut, all your friends were down there, and you had a nice dinner, presents.
Good birthday.
Yeah.
Good dinner.
Seems like we celebrated Pauly's birthday over and over again.
Maybe I'm just jealous.
I don't know.
Do you know where the keys are? Well, they're obviously in my hands.
- Busted big time.
- We're leaving.
What do you mean you're leaving? We're leaving.
Are we going? No, you guys go.
I have my running shoes on.
Okay.
Bye, guys.
- Bye-bye.
- It's cool.
- I'm just, like, tone-deaf and stupid when it comes to Mike at this point.
It's like, "what the hell happened to this kid?" Ever since Italy, Mike's being, like, crazy weird.
We don't know what's up with Mike.
I'm trying to hold it in right now.
I wear my heart on my sleeve and it actually hurts me to think that people don't care.
Yeah.
I could walk by myself, but at the end of the day, I just I'm just very, uh Very emotional dude, you know? And I'm starting to see that no matter how good I am, I'm never seen as the good guy.
I'm always seen as somebody that's going to be bad.
I don't know what just happened.
He's in a funk.
And that's why I've been a little upset.
There's always going to be drama with the roommates, but I'm tired of being the bad dude.
Oh! - Bull's-eye, kid! - Yes! Oh, Mike did a dip.
- No, he didn't.
- Mm-hmm.
- No, he didn't.
- Uh-huh.
He's not here? Sometimes I do really feel bad for Mike.
But it's like, "why do you alienate yourself?" Like, he's just doing it to himself.
- What happened? - Mike's gone.
- What? - Did the dip.
Oh, come on.
Really? Like, I get vinny's anxiety, and I get that he wanted to go.
We're supporting vinny and his problems.
Mike just pulled a douche bag move.
He just dipped out.
And we're down to six.
Dropping like flies.
- Oh, dear.
- What's going on? Vinny's not around.

[dance music] - You want to go down? - Let's go.
- Cheers! - To Vinny back! - Whoo-hoo! - I'm gonna cruise over here for a bit.
- It's not surprising that as soon as we get there, Mike takes off and, like, does his own thing.
- I love this guy.
- He's all right.
- But that's it.
- Yo, don't talk to staten island girls, bro.
- I got my bitch Vinny back in the club, and it's great.
I turn around, Vinny's right there, and he's by my side.
He's my wingman.
I'm his wingman.
It's a perfect match.
[dance music] - we were meant to be magical we were meant to be free see the sunlight that's on my face and how is it it could be - I [bleep] peed on myself.
I got really excited, dancing with, like, my girls, And I, legit, peed myself.
Don't tell anybody.
Dude, I peed everywhere.
- Oh, my God.
Nicole is out of control.
She's fricking peeing on the dance floor.
It's crazy.
Like, thank God nobody else saw it.
- I need perfume.
Cool.
[spraying] Honestly, I don't care.
If you spray perfume and take a shore shower, That's still considered a shower.
Thanks! Bye! Don't call me dirty.
I'm not dirty.
I smell phenomenal.
- [laughs] - In Italy, you know, everybody hated me, you know, So I'm absolutely nice now.
- [laughs] It's like, what--it's like, what are you up to? When are you blowing up the house? Are you a [bleep] terrorist? - I'm going to piss.
Oh, this is gonna be bad.
Something funky's going on.
Like, I can't control my bladder.
If I piss blood, can we go to the doctor tonight? - Okay.
- Oh, God, where am I? I don't know what everybody's doing.
- Home? - Home, home.
- Come on, Mike.
- Someone stole my slippers.
- [laughs] - I gotta take a piss so bad right now.
- I'm gonna just make myself a hot pocket.
- I'm right here.
I didn't do anything, so shut the [bleep] up, okay? Just shut the [bleep] up.

I tried to do it discreetly so nobody saw.
Whatever.
Oh, God, I have no underwear on.
[retches] Party foul times ten.
- Need to wash these.
Oh, my God.
I kind of just went too hard last night.
My fused extensions got caught onto my clip-in extensions, And my hair is in a legit knot right now.
This is not okay.
This is not a good time at all.
[electrical zapping] What the hell? I got [bleep] electrocuted.
Sam! I just got electrocuted.
My hand hurts.
[hairdryer humming] My whole arm was, like, tingling, and I'm just, like, I cannot believe I just electrocuted myself.
If you get electrocuted, does it mean, like, You get [bleep] up? - Like, what do you mean? - Like, do you think my brain's a little crazy? - Like your brain's crazy? I don't think so.
I think you'll be okay.
Police zap criminals with their electric guns - Oh, that's true.
- All the time, and they're all right.
- Yeah, maybe it just shocks you a little bit.
Is it the same electrical, though? - It has to be.
- Yeah? - There's different electrocutions? - I think so.
I think, like, a wall electrocution Is, like, electronics.
- Yeah, but I think, like, when the police do it, They zap the people and they, like, go down, 'cause it's so bad.
Like, you just got a little zap in your arm.
You should be all right.
- Yeah.
I'm like, what the hell is wrong with these electronics? Like, things that plug in the walls, Like, watts, or whatever they're called.
Come on.
- All right, let's go.
Let's get the [bleep] out of here.
- I have no shorts.
- I want to go to jenks.
- Oh, I'll got to jenks.
- Yeah.
It's a beautiful day.
Let's go to [bleep] jenks.
[upbeat music] Are you gonna get drunk today? - Yeah, I'll have fun.
- Promise? - I don't know about the others, though.
- We need to get Vinny drunk.
- Yeah.
- I feel.
Was it fun last night? You were with him, right? - No, I ended up veering off somehow.
Ronnie, Vinny, and pauly stayed together.
- Every time we go somewhere, like, as a group, Mike gets over us really quickly.
It's like he doesn't want to hang out with all of us.
- I gotta get dressed.
- If you look up "too much swag" in the dictionary, There'll be a great big picture of my face.
[dance music] - Whoa, I'm gonna throw up.
I'm gonna throw up.
Don't do that.
- Don't--you don't throw up.
[line ringing] - Hey, it's Roger.
Leave me a message.
[message machine beeps] - I really wish you'd answer your phone.
I love you.
Bye.
- Dee! Where'd she go? Maybe I'll just put these over.
I'm wearing two underwears right now.
Just remembering what happened last night, I peed myself.
I don't want that to happen again in a thong, So, you know, over the thong I put on Booty shorts, Just in case.
Should I wear it? - Well, if you want to be fun.
You look like a walking party.
- Do I look okay in this - [laughs] yeah.
- T-shirt? - Yeah.
[spraying] Oh, I sprayed myself already.
[spraying] - I feel you.
[bleep].
I got to make sure my boys are smelling good.
- Mike's been good lately.
Not crazy.
He ain't trying to kick [bleep].
But I just want to know, what's he up to And when is he blowing up the house? - In Italy, you know, everybody hated me, you know? So now I'm so nice now.
- [laughs] It's like, what--it's like, what are you up to? It's like, what are you up to? When are you blowing up the house? Are you a [bleep] terrorist? - [laughs] - I feel like [bleep] pauly, like, makes gestures, And I hate that.
You know, I feel like the boys are plotting against me.
- Say something.
- You're peeing? - All the bathrooms are taken.
- They pee outside and drink out of bowls.
- We don't need pets.
- Oh, my God! This should be on the fashion runway.
- Cab's here.
Cab's here.
- Let's do it out.
Ready? - I would be an awesome runway model.
- Whoo! - We're going to fricking jenks again today, And I love jenks, and I'm like Sunday, fun day at jenkinson's and I'm really excited - [bleep].
- Mike! - What's up, brother? How's everything, big dog? I'm actually a native to this area, So I'm bound to run into a friend Pretty much wherever I go.
What's up, dog? Yo, you'll have to sit like in the corner or something, man.
You have to sit there, dude.
- It's just weird because whenever Mike is around, Like, an entourage of guys come, so - Oh, you come here.
No, you just come around.
- I don't know if these are actually Mike's friends Or just randoms that he met at the club Or pulled off the street.
I don't know.
[overlapping chatter] - You know Bobby, right? I'm just gonna let him chill over there, You know what I mean? - I'm going to piss.
Oh, this is gonna be bad.
The fact that I peed myself at the club, Something funky's going on.
Like, I can't control my bladder.
If I piss blood, can we go to the doctor tonight? - No, tomorrow.
It hurts.
I can't deal with it.
- Mike's being a [bleep].
I thought we were all supposed to stay together, And he's, like, talking to strangers.
- Why does Mike [bleep] do what he does? - I'm not washing my hands.
- Yeah, I don't ever do it.
- I feel like I have a uti right now, Because I have to pee every two seconds.
So uti doesn't stand for ultimate tanning institute.
It stands for a urinary tract infection.
But you could call it either way.
I'm in pain right now, So I need something to take away the pain.
- What are you gonna do? What do you want to do? - Tequila.
With salt.
Oh, [bleep] you, uti.
I'm a vet tech, and I know what to do When it comes to utis.
I got us two Tequila shots because I need pain medication.
So drinking when you have a uti is kind of, you know, Like a painkiller, like, anesthesia.
Like, you don't feel it.
Oh, I need to go to the doctor.
I have a [bleep] uti and it hurts like balls.
Or I'm pregnant.
- Hey, let's go.
Yo, do you want to go? - Let's do batting cages.
- No, I want to stay.
I want to stay at the bar over at the club.
It's a nice day.
There's girls around.
There's music.
There's the bar.
Why am I gonna leave? - Let's go do batting cages real quick.
- I'm chillin' here.
Y'all can leave.
I'm gonna--I'm gonna-- - Do you remember the little talk we had? - There's music, there's drinks.
- Whatever.
- Like, believe me, like, I'm--I'm chillin'.
- Wait, I've got to finish my drink.
- God, this is not my scene.
There's, like, [bleep] nine-year-olds.
- We're actually dressed kind of well.
Nothing's showing.
- Do you want to go first, bro? - No, you can go.
- [laughs] - What's up, girls? Roll on through this way.
This is where the party's at, this way.
It doesn't make sense for us to leave And play baseball d walk around miserable.
See, this--this is where the party's at, right here.
I pretty much start my own little party In the corner of the club.
Cheers.
Cheers.
- I haven't played baseball in a year.

- Mike! - Okay.
- Fun cab! Whoo! - You're in the fun cab! You're in the fun cab! - Me, Deena, and Mike get into the cab.
Everybody else goes in the other cab.
And I'm like, okay, Maybe we can start being friends like we used to be.
No, no! - Deena, snooki, Deena.
Like, I'm being so nice to every single person, And there's not one thing I did wrong to somebody.
- Mike, you need to hang out with us.
- Just so you all know-- just so you all know, I feel like there's certain people in the crib That like to gang up and talk [bleep] behind my back, Because, "a," I've been nice.
- You don't hang out with us.
- If I--I--I'm with you guys - Mike, you need to stop [bleep] going away from us.
- You know, he feels left out, And I feel like that's why he's saying this.
- Today, Ronnie was like, "people think you're playing this [bleep]," And I was like, "really?" And, like, I'm--like, y'all think I'm playing this [bleep]? And, like, I feel like [bleep] pauly, like, Makes gestures, and I hate that.
When it's just me and him, nothing but love, But when some of the others are around, I get, like, uh-- - so call him out on it.
And say, "what the [bleep]?" - I feel like the boys are plotting against me, And I'm by myself and I better get ready To pretty much, you know, defend myself.
- Say something.
- I don't know who's talkin' [bleep], But I know somebody is.
- Just figure it out.
- Say [bleep], [bleep].
- They'll all say "nobody.
" To what point do I now say [bleep]? Here comes the situation, you know, And you're not gonna like it.
- Meow, meow, meow.
- Why are you putting beer on it? - Snooki is covered in black soot, And it is the best day of my life.
[laughter] - Ron! - I have to pee.
[upbeat music] - Can I pee with you in here? I don't care.
Mike! - I'm in the bathroom! - I've gotta pee.
I'm gonna go pee outside.
Where can I pee? I'm gonna pee over here.
I don't care.
I'm peeing.
Oh, God.
Oh, oh.
Ew! I needed to pee.
[laughs] oh, my God.
- You're peeing? - All the bathrooms are taken.
I don't give a [bleep].

Then it won't smell like piss.
I'm going to play.
- Gym, tan, I need some clearasil.
Gym, tan, I need some [bleep] clearasil.
That's what the deal is.

- I'm being honest.
Do you want me to be honest? - I'm walking up to the party deck, Like, I don't even know what's going on.
Oh, my God.
Your drawers are down.
- I happen to have a very bold, bold, bold personality.
- So do I.
- I don't bother anybody.
- All I see is Mike's pants unzipped, And his wiener just, like, barely hanging out, And I'm just like, what the hell is going on? - There's no reason to, like, be mean to me or anything.
I-I try to be nice to everybody.
I've been really trying hard in Jersey.
- No, I know you have.
- And everybody thinks I have, like, Hidden agendas and [bleep].
It's not true.
I make it my business to be nice to every single person In a different way every day.
I make it my business.
- Yo, I swear to God, That thing's talking to me right now, bro.
- I know.
I can't look.
This is why I'm, like, weirded out and staring at Ronnie.
- Mike is just [bleep] up right now And doesn't even realize that his [bleep] is out.
- I'm trying not to turn around.
I keep looking at it.
I'm eye level with it right now.
- You guys treat me like-- it actually upsets me, like, You know what I mean? And I just feel that some of y'all, Like, either, "a," don't believe me, Or "b," think I got something, like I'm a terrorist, Like I'm planning some [bleep].
Like, yo, Ronnie today, he said, "Mike is being extra-special nice, "but he's planning something.
He's, like, a terrorist.
" I'm just saying, like, I'm just being real.
You guys are my brothers and sisters, And like, uh, if there's anything, Anything I do at any time, please tell me.
I'll fix it.
You know what I mean? Like, please.
- I hear you.
- All right, dude.
All right.
- I'm, like, mind-[bleep] that my terrorist comment Actually, like, set Mike off like that.
Like, it's a [bleep] joke, Mike.
- Yo, what was that all about, brah? - There's nothing I could-- else I could do.
Snooks.
Like, there's--there's actually nothing else I could do.
Like, I could-- - You should say what's on your mind right now.
- I confronted every single person outside, And everybody said everything's cool.
So there's nothing else I can do, You know what I mean? Come with me.
I-I need to--I need to-- I need to talk to you.
Where are you going? Go out the other way.
Go out that way.
Like, I told everybody, I said, "please," you know what I mean? "if y'all-- if y'all got a-- "y'all got a problem with me or whatever in any way, Please tell me.
" - But you told me pauly's being fake, So why didn't you call pauly out? - No, I just went up to him just now and I'm like-- But I didn't single him out.
- Say what you really feel, you idiot.
- I can't accuse people because I don't know anything.
- Don't accuse people.
Just say, "this is how I feel.
What the [bleep] is going on?" - Listen, it's either I'm 100% nice or 100% mean.

It's time for me to stand up and confront people.
Press Ã¡69, 'cause you-- I-I wanna re-- I just want to rewind the phone call that you just started, 'cause I'm gonna have to deal with it in about five minutes.

Everything's fine.

<.
You heat up this warm beer, And on the bottom of the beer, It develops this, like, soot type [bleep], And the person that's standing next to the person With the warm beer is actually gonna get soot on their face.
You do it so they can't see that it's there, like-- - All right.
It's a memory game, and snooki has the attention span Of a [bleep] fish, So we know that we're gonna get away with this.
Snooki! So I'm like, "yeah, I'll do it.

I'll see youse.
Let me go do your grocery shopping.
[upbeat music] - What's going on, Mike? - I'm gonna try to get my first tat.
- Are you? - When I'm on break, I happen to run into Roger.
I'm like, wow.
Jenni complains about he's not calling her back.
It's a standoff.
And then, all of a sudden, Roger shows up out of nowhere.
- Good to see you, big dog.
- I have to tell jenni as soon as I get home.
- That was horrible.
- You want some of mine? - No, I want chocolate today, I think.
- You want me to get yours? I'll go-- I'm on my break still.
I'm trying to be nice.
I'm sorry, Deena.
I'm trying to be nice.
- I know.
I'm kidding, jerk.
- Come on.
Like, you know what I mean? You see, I make it a point to be nice to every single person.
I confronted everybody last night in front of everybody, And I'm like, if you have a problem with me, please tell me.
- Mm-hmm.
- So I'm gonna take it that everything's good, But I just don't think they wanted to say what they, You know, if they were saying anything or not, you know? - I have no idea.
- Because what you and snooks were getting at Is that they are talking.
- With me, I mean, I can't even speak for everyone else.
It's like, I love when you're like this, And I hope you just stay like this.
- Maybe I got a little too drunk yesterday or whatever, but-- - And also, you know, maybe, I felt like that in Italy.
Remember, I thought everybody was talking about me And no one was? Sometimes you just [bleep] your head up.
- Yeah, but when I talked to snooki in the car with you, Snooki was like, "yo, like, stick up for yourself.
" And I'm like, "what are you talking about? I don't know what people are saying.
" - Mike is definitely like Jekyll and Hyde.
Like, one minute, he's, like, really sweet and nice, And the next minute, he's, like, At the drop of the dime, a nut.
- When I spoke to snooki, she made me feel like-- - She was also drunk, though.
- Really? - She's said some--sometimes she says things to me, though.
- But you too, though.
You too, though.
You kind of agreed with her.
- No, just like, If you feel like people are talking about you, You say something.
- Um, who knows.
This could be just a-- a joke.
I'm very confused right now.
I feel like I'm being volleyed back and forth From the boys to snooki and Deena, And it's like, who's telling the truth And who's lying? - Hi.
Love you.
- Want to go to the gym or something? - Yeah.
- Let's go.
- This is Blake's last sale.
You guys are out.
- Bye.
- Nice to meet you.
- I don't know when I'm gonna be able to see Roger.
I'm agitated.
- Uh, I have to tell jenni about seeing Roger, But it's like, uh, by telling jenni, It might start drama.
I just saw Roger.
- With his friends? - Yeah.
Yeah, he was at the boardwalk on the beach.
- He was on the beach or on the path? - Yeah, he told me he was on the beach.
- Was he clothes shopping or, like, in beach gear? - Beach gear.
- I am just so pissed off at this moment.
That pisses me off.
Mike saw Roger on the boardwalk, shopping, And on the beach with his boys, and I'm mad at him right now, 'cause I can't believe he didn't call me back.
You saw Roger today? - No.
- Mike said he did.
- No.
- He was hanging out on the beach, Like, right in front of the shore store.
- He's not hanging out with you? - But he's, like, right there, And he has his day off, so I'm He will have to do some serious, Serious apologizing and making up.
It's not all right.
[bleep] pissed me off.
I don't even want to talk to him.
- Dad, you ready? - Let's go.
- See ya.
Have a wonderful day.
- Can you carry me there? - No.
- I'm too tired.
[driving rock music] - Hey, guys, I just want to, um, like, I just want to apologize If there's anything that I have done And if there's anything that I am going to do-- - I'm apologizing now.
- I'm gonna apologize-- - And apologize later.
- [laughs] - I was like, "yo, you gotta be up to something, brah.
It's like, you've been way too nice.
" I'm like, "you're like a terrorist.
" - Plotting and [bleep].
- You're plotting something.
But I was just joking, and he took it so serious, bro.
- What up, sir? - What up? How was work? - Eh, it was all right.
You know what I mean? - How was gym? - Yeah, good.
- My bad, buddy.
I think somebody was just trying to stir the pot, So I apologize.
- Mike is like a broken record.
He sticks to, like, one topic a day.
So he's always apologetic one day And he'll stick to that all day.
Tomorrow, it'll be a new frickin' thing And he'll stick to it all day, Whether he's hooking up with a chick, You'll hear about it the whole day.
- And I think I know what's up, you know what I mean? Somebody was just trying to cause a little trouble.
- All right.
- I know the-- I know the deal now, And I'm gonna have to fix it, you know? - Good.
- It has nothing to do with the guys.
- Yeah, yeah, no, I figured that.
I figured that.
- We're pretty much finding out Who the real troublemaker is, and, um, it's snooki.
They were doing it for their benefit, so-- So that I don't say anything, - But now-- now it's on now.
First time I see him.
- Well, I'm glad that you realize.
- Somebody [bleep] up.
It's really [bleep] up.
You know what I mean? - The whole morning Mike is saying, you know, "I don't have ulterior motives for doing anything.
I'm a nice guy.
" And at this moment, Mike is planning on retaliating Against snooki and getting her back And telling jionni some, like, deep, dark secrets.
- Wait till I see him.
I can't believe I got [bleep] blindsided like that by her.
- He's gonna let unit know to call jionni Or set jionni up somehow.
- Yo.
What's up, bro? - What up, [bleep]? - Like, the real Mike is back, And I love watching all the [bleep] he does.
I got my popcorn ready.
Let's get the show on the road.
- Come down, uh, and untangle the business That was, uh, unfinished.
- But everything was up today.
- Everything was actually nice, But then, all of a sudden, something happened yesterday And you start with me and, you know, I'm gonna finish it, you know? I'm kind of in the mood for a little trouble.
- What's your name? - Deanna.
- I'm Vinny.
I know that deanna is probably a sure thing, But then there's this other girl that's, like, really hot.
But Deena is keeping the girl deanna on the backburner.
- I'm gonna piss.
Oh, this is is gonna be bad.
Something funky's going on, like I can't control my bladder.
If I piss blood, can we go to the doctor tonight? - I feel like [bleep].
Pauly like makes gestures, and I hate that.
I feel like the boys are plotting against me.
- Say something.
- I feel like one of you guys are mad at me for something.
- Hey, it's Roger.
Leave me a message.
[beep] - I haven't seen Roger and I feel like something's up.
- I happen to run into Roger.
I'm like "wow!" I just saw Roger on the beach.
- I am just so pissed off at this moment.
- He's not hanging out with you? - But he's like right there.
Adriano_CSI - Dj pauly delvecchio! - I'm going to the Jersey shore, bitch! - All right, we got a situation.

- Yeah.
Totally.
- We'll be barbequing this summer.
Get there safe.
- I think I know what's up.
You know what I mean? Somebody just tried to cause a little trouble.
I can't believe I got [bleep] blindsided like that by her.
We're pretty much finding out who the real troublemaker is, And um, it's snooki.
[line trilling] - Yo, what's up, bro? - What up? I was gonna have you come down or whatever And handle the business that was unfinished.
- I'm in Miami with mark.
- Oh, you're in Miami? [bleep].
I had planned for my boy unit to come down And tell jionni the truth On how snooki cheated on jionni with me.
But unfortunately for me, the unit's in Miami.
- I'd rather be up there to be honest with you.
- Maybe I'll wait till you get back.
Whatever.
- All right.
- Did you know that, um, Frank hung out with deena's sister? - Yeah, dude.
- He called me at 4:00 A.
M.
And he was like, "had a good date with deena's sister.
" Deena's sister had slept with my brother.
I was like "yo, ask deena's sister What she wants for breakfast in the morning.
" - [laughing] - I think it's hilarious.
And I want them to continue to hook up So I can have some more fun with it.
- Supposedly there's some good things about her.
- Really? - They're very good things.
- She likes the [bleep] highway? - [laughing] Nope.

- Hey, I never said that.
- It's a mystery to me if a girl [bleep] to me, Because I've never seen it But supposedly deena's sister's [bleep].

I'm sure I could use that information to my advantage.
All right, peace.

- I'm gonna be chilling out laying down.
- All right.
- Yo, is jenni still downstairs? - I definitely feel like I haven't seen Roger As much as I should being her.
Our relationship's been so good that I'm kinda waiting For something to happen.
I'm just like mind-[bleep]ing myself.
- You all right? - No, it's just that I never had I don't wanna talk about it.
- All right.
I hate seeing jenni sad.
You know, she's been going through a rough time Because she misses Roger and I know she's breaking down.
Well, your hair looks gorgeous.
But at least she got her hair done, so that's good.
You look pretty.
- [snoring] - Hey, dude.
Do you wanna go out? - No, I got a headache.
- I'm just honestly trying to be Mike's friend.
I wanna be close to him and have fun, go out, have drinks.
But I feel like Mike's just brushing me off.
Now I know why people don't wanna hang out with you, 'cause you don't hang out with them.
[hip-hop music] - Aztec I call it a sweatbox.
'cause it's not big and there's just sweat and b.
O.
Everywhere.
I kinda feel like I'm back in Italy.
Minus the armpit hair.
- Jenni's just like in her funk And I don't know what's going on with her.
Let's give jenni a lap dance.
- Really? - This is annoying.
Honestly, I wanna hang out with my girl.
You're leaving? - I gotta work in the morning.
I'll be all right.
Just have fun.
- Okay.
- All right.
I haven't seen Roger.
It's just not my night.
So I'm just gonna go to bed.
- Can I get a shot? - What do you want a shot of? - What's your name? - Deanna.
- Deanna? - Yes.
- I'm vinny.
I know that Deanna is probably a sure thing I would say.
But she's still like a five or a six.
During the weekend, You're looking for like a seven or an eight.
Go over there for one second.
One second.
One second.
You gotta go over there for one second.
All right, last resort.
- They're ready to go I think.
They're good I think.
- Yeah, yeah.
I turn around, and then there's this other girl That's like really hot.
I'm like yes! You know what I mean? Hey, that's your boyfriend, that guy you're with? - That's my brother.
- That's your brother? - That's good for you.
- This girl Nikki's like a straight-up, hot-ass chick.
- - That one's a hundred times better than the other one.
- Vinny, I love you, but Busted.
- I'm back.
- Hello? - Where the hell have you been? - All right, you wanna play this game.
Okay.
- I feel like I know where I stand, And therefore he can go [bleep] himself.
- I'm gonna call my sister now.
- [mumbling] Well, I know the first date went well.
- No comment.
I'm definitely the best wing woman ever.
I'm dancing with this girl, I'm keeping her away from vinny and the other girl.
- Deena kept the other chick occupied.
That's a good wingman right there.
- I feel like I'm an ultimate good time right now.
- Cheers! - Jenni left the club.
I'm drunk right now and I have no idea what's going on.
So I just walk home.
Well, okay.
Whoo.
The boardwalk now is kinda like a piece of cake When you walk on it drunk Because it's nothing compared to the cobblestones.
Oh, my God.
My body's dying right now.
Ugh.
You don't know what goes on.
You're not [indistinct].
[hiccup] Oh, my God, I've never been this drunk in my life.
- All right, let's find girls.
You help me out, I help you out.
- Wait, do you like guys too? - No.
- You don't like guys at all? What the [bleep]? That's a challenge to me.
Lesbian girls can like guys.
I'm feminine, I got soft features.
You know what I mean? I mean, I think I'm a good transition for a lesbian girl.
She don't like [bleep] guys.
- I mean, you're cute, but you're not that cute.
- You good? Let's go.
Roll out.
- Nobody's coming.
- They'll come, they always do.
You got someone to [bleep] tonight, you're good.
- Might, I don't know.
You know what I'm saying? I told you who I want, but Didn't work.
When you take a lesbian back to the straight team, That is like Christopher Columbus Like discovering America.
That is a major accomplishment.
- I have the same [bleep] skirt on.
- I'm not gonna [bleep] her.
- One in pink and one in blue.
- All right, can you stop pointing out the girl? 'cause then you're gonna ruin my chances - Oh.
- If I do have to bang one of them.
I'm [bleep] psycho, so I keep trying with the lesbian girl.
But deena is being the ultimate wing person right now And keeping the girl deanna on the back burner.
Because we all know that I'm gonna need a plan b.
- So are you dtf? - Dtf? - Yeah.
- I don't think I would do that honestly.
- No? - I want deena on my team.
You're a good team player.
- Ron.
- Where's pauly? - Is it gay if I [bleep]? - No.
- No homo.
- I do it every night.
- Whoa! - Pauly's walking with a blondie that dtf.
Vinny's walking with the "let's be honest.
" And I have the other girl that has no idea What the hell she's getting herself into.
- This is my room.
That's my bed.
- It's nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you too.
- I just can't.
I'm not trying to - You don't wanna come in? - No.
- It's fine.
It's okay, I understand.
- Have fun with what's her name? - I don't know.
I don't know her name.
- All right.
[kiss] have fun.
- Okay, you too.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Be careful, okay? - You too.
- I'm disappointed to see Nikki walk away, But listen.
I worked hard, you know what I'm saying? I'm proud of myself.
Ugh.
But tonight is like Christmas.
Deena has a backup girl for me on reserve Just in case Nikki fell through.
And right now, that's happening.
So it's awesome that I have a girl home And I didn't have to try.
[dial tone] [line trilling] - Hello? - Where the hell have you been? - [laughing] Jesse [bleep] took my phone with him yesterday From the beach.
I drove back to the house.
I just got my phone back.
- Oh, you didn't work today? - No, I took off 'cause I didn't have a phone.
Just don't worr what's wrong? - Nothing.
- Nothing? I know you well enough to know something's wrong.
- No, nothing.
- All right, you wanna play this game? Okay.
- I am just so pissed off at this moment, I just wanna get off the phone with him.
Bye.
You know what pisses me off? The fact that he took the [bleep] day off.
You know what I mean? I get my ass reamed out when he [bleep] tells me like, "I can't take the day off.
I only have a certain amount of them.
" "oh, well, I had to take the day off 'cause I couldn't find my [bleep] phone.
" You have a work phone.
I feel like I know where I stand, And therefore he can go [bleep] himself.
Not gonna ask.
You know what? I'm not gonna talk to him.
Agh, I'm so mad.
- First of all, I'm not apologizing for anything I did.
You said your piece, and then you hung up like a coward.
- Jesus Christ, I didn't think This was gonna be that type of call.
- [giggling] where we going? - I don't really care.
- Where the two girls at? - Oh, I have no idea.
- You're kidding me.
- You're gonna need to kiss.
- Oh, God.
- Why the [bleep] am I up? Jesus, take the wheel.
Why am I alive? I don't feel good.
I need a [bleep] therapist.
And I need a.
A.
Meetings At this point.
I'm gonna take a little nap.
Whoa.
[crack] whoa! Whoa.
Oh, phenomenal.
Ow, you hurt my eyeballs.
This sun's too powerful today.
Hey, seagull.
Good morning! Daytime, altogether, is so [bleep] annoying.
Like go away.
It got so bright out.
I hate you.
In arkansas, it's always dark out.
So you just-- everything's dark always.
[scoffs] Cool.
- My smush with this girl wasn't that bad.
This was an average girl, average smush.
Nothing extraordinary, but it was still fun.
Release some demons, you know? - Bye.
- I need a crocodilly.
Something going on in my stomach That's telling me to poop or throw up.
I feel it.
It's like a walking meatball, marinated in alcohol.
Oh, my god, I'm gonna vomit.
Oh, my god, I really don't feel good.
Oh, my god, I need to go to sleep.
Ew, there's a stain.
[duck quacking] - Hello? - Yo, is jenni there? - This is-- Oh, hey, what's going on? - I'm stuck at work, so I'm gonna be late.
- Really? Roger's calling me an hour before he's supposed to be here And telling me that he's running late 'cause he's still at work.
And I'm officially fed up.
- I can probably be there Like 5:00.
- I have to back by 6:30.
- Well, do you wanna reschedule For a different day or something? - No, I mean, if that's how it's gonna be, like whatever.
I just thought that you would try for me.
'cause you know how much it means to me.
I was just calling you to give you the courtesy That I'm running late.
But if you wanna cancel it, then-- - No, you asked to reschedule.
- Because you had this sound in your voice Like it wasn't happening.
So I said "okay, do you wanna reschedule?" I was giving you the option.
Like it's always gloom and doom and drama with you.
- Gloom and doom? - I'm at work, what can I do? - I always put roger first, And today I don't feel like I'm first in his life.
He could've did whatever it took to make sure He was here at 4:00 and he didn't.
You can't be here for two and half hours.
You can't be here.
I asked you to go on the beach with me before In the-- when we first got here.
You didn't wanna go on the beach 'cause you weren't ready.
I find out your on the beach with your boys though.
That hurt.
I didn't get a hold of you for 48 hours.
I call, I find out you took a day off Because you forgot your phone, which you have a work phone So you could've went to work with your work phone.
But no, you decide to take it off And go hang out at the beach with your [bleep] boys.
Which I've been asking for three [bleep] weeks to do for you, And now you wanna be late? You wanna re-cancel? Go do it.
Do what you gotta do.
But just know that I waited for the beach for you, You never waited for me.
You can't make it, that's on you.
I try--I got up, I'm dressed, and I'm [bleep] ready.
Not doing it.
[sigh] Cancelled again.
- You gonna be all right? - He knew how much it meant to me today.
[bleep] him.
- He's just being [bleep].
He's a guy.
They don't understand.

- I'm scared.
- What's up with my brother? You know, deena's sister.
You're telling me it was a smash and dash pretty much.

- How the hell can the meatballs do this? You can't just leave work without telling anybody.
- All right, pauly, I'm gonna go look for those [bleep] two dingbats right now.
- Okay.
- See what's going on.
All right.
- I'll hold down the fort.
- I appreciate it.

Put the music on! The boss is gone! Put the music on! - Oh, hold up.
There she is.
- Yeah, crazy, though.
Like the worst I've ever seen in my whole entire life.
Like there's nothing like it.
So there's this girl.
She bought something at the store the other day.
But now I have not stopped seeing this girl.
Every time I turn around, she's there.
I never spoke to her.
I can't even look outside the t-shirt shop, 'cause I keep looking at her and she looks at me in the eye.
And it's scary.
I wanna see what her room looks like.
But not with her in it.
You know what I mean? - Cheers.
- Oh, god.
- No, just hide.
- Are you kidding me, guys? What the hell are you doing? Deena, come here! Let's get serious.
Come on.
- Right now, danny is being such an annoying-- Trying to get us back to work.
I feel like we're above the law.
You're not my friend anymore.
- The shore store! - Look who I found, pauly.
- Where were they? - Where do you think they were? - Bar.
- You're cute.
- Good guess.
You're gonna make sales, right? - Yeah.
I just need lip gloss real quick.
- Deena, seems like you're in rare form.
Make some sales please.
- Yeah.
- I'll help you.
- Excuse me, miss.
Where's a good place to get a drink on the boardwalk? - A drink? - Yeah, like where's your favorite place? - Nicole meets this bachelorette girl, And she's like, "you know I'm getting married.
" And we're like, "oh, that's awesome.
" Nicole's like, "dee, we gotta get out of here And we'll drink with this girl.
" And I'm like, "all right, we'll go get drinks with her.
" - Don't like feel bad.
Whatever.
- Where the meatballs? - Are you kidding me? - Danny has no control over these meatballs whatsoever.
- How do they do this? Right now, I hate your two roommates.
I tried.
I try to be nice to them.
- You did.
- And they just don't care.
So just let 'em know that they'll be in trouble.
- Thanks, my dude.
- Thank you, man.
- Punch me out.
- You'rere out of here.
- Thank you for shopping at the shore store.
Please come again.
- [snoring] - Pauly? - Yo.
- How was work? - You don't even wanna know.
- What? - I gotta tell you something about this girl.
There's the biggest stalker I've ever met In my whole entire life.
- Oh, dj pauly d with the tattoo? - She's there every day in the same hat, same outfit.
Same everything.
She's crazy.
- You ever see misery? - Yes, that's what's gonna happen.
- She's gonna smash your kneecaps.
- I hope she feeds me.
A brand-new stalker.
She's crazy.
Scary.
Help! For the meatballs then, or--? - I mean, I don't even know what the plan is.
- Can I go with you to find them? I am not surprised that the meatballs did the dip at work.
The only thing I'm worried about Is I'm not getting stuck with mike.
I will find the meatballs.
- Let's roll out.
- Play pool somewhere or something.
- All right.
- Oh, wait.
There they are.
Goinin or-- - no.
- Have fun.
Bye now.
- What's up, guys? - They're gonna get wasted right now.
Or they're getting wasted.
- Whoa! - Play with me! - This is the jwoww that I like.
Her and roger are fighting right now And she just wants to have a good time.
And so it's like, "missed you!" - I wasn't getting stuck with mike.
- Oh, my god.
Where did she come from? It's not funny anymore.
- Bro, I'm scared.
Man, there's a stalker of all stalkers.
I cannot look to my right without this girl being there.
- She wants to be a stalker.
She don't wanna be your girl.
Like, she wants to be your stalker.
- Like, vinny, I gotta keep moving.
Can you get me out of here before I flip out? Yo, where'd she go? - I don't know.
- I'm scared.
- Wanna play pool? - All right.
- What the [bleep]? Where is everybody? Are you kidding me? They just left? I sometimes isolate myself.
I do like to be alone sometimes, But I also like to know that people care.
Kidding me? This whole summer been nothing but nice.
And it really doesn't matter because at the end of the day, No matter how nice I am, the nice guy gets stepped on.
So sooner or later, the bad guy's gonna come out.
- There's pauly's stalker.
- Stop, dude, get out of here! - Ahh! Yo, what is going on right now? There's a war out there.
- What are we gonna do? - I don't know, but I'm not staying home.
- Are you down for 507? - Where is everybody? - Ooh.
- Yo, mike! - Yo.
- Coming out.
- Yeah.
- Mike's coming.
Whoo.
- Yeah.
- Let's go now! - I am very confused right now.
Nicole is acting like she's my best friend.
- I'm happy you're coming out 'cause last night you fell asleep and you annoyed me.
I have a uti.
I'm still chugging along.
- Although in the back of my head I have plans of demise, I'll go with her to get a drink, see what's up.
- You okay? - I didn't sleep last night 'cause I was so pissed off.
I just laid here.
Me and roger are fighting right now, Because he called in sick over misplacing his phone.
Yet he gives me [bleep] For making him call into work for me.
I'm doing the best I can.
I try at work.
- Poopie, you'll be fine.
- Oh, we look hot if we dance like this.
- We should've been the strippers.
- Come on, mike! - [burps] - Team meatballs and mike! - Team meatballs and sitch! Hey! - Yeah, we got this.
I'm having fun, vinny's back.
We're killing it.
We're playing a couple of chicks.
And we meet this couple from brooklyn, we're playing them.
- Yo, what do I do here, bro? - Having mad fun.
That was [indistinct].
I gotta tell you.
Vinny likes you.
He's really shy.
Vinny's back, so I gotta play around with it a little bit.
- What's up? - I'm good, right? - What? - There you go.
- What's up? - Be aggressive, be aggressive.
- Vinny.
Ooh! - See, he's shy.
He's mad shy.
He's not liking it at all.
I try to hook you up.
- He keep laying it on me and laying it on me, Laying it on me.
And then like I can make one move, though, That'll [bleep] up all of his moves, you know? Like, for example, there's a specific girl standing-- - I'm sorry.
- There's a specific girl.
- Everywhere we go, everywhere we turn, There's pauly's stalker right behind us.
We don't know how she gets there, How she knows where we are.
You, come here.
- I apologize.
- Come here.
- I apologize.
I apologize.
- You.
We think that she snuck a gps system into pauly's blowout, And that's how she knows where he is every time.
It's crazy.
He always sees you around, And he's very shy, but he wanted to say hello to you.
- Hello.
How are you? - What's your name? - Vanessa.
- Vanessa.
So, pauly, you're welcome.
- Nice to meet you.
- You're welcome.
I'll leave you two alone now.
- That's my sister's name-- vanessa.
- I'll leave you two alone, and you know, we're good.
- For real.
He's funny though, right? I gotta live with him.
It's a war out there as it is, But me and vinny are putting grenades on each other.
So he's throwing a grenade at me, I'm dodging it.
It's a war.
Gotta go to the bathroom real bad.
- What happened? - Oh, my god.
Fair to say vinny won this battle, But he will not win the war.
I can't believe you did that to me, bro.
- Well, you asked for it.
- Can I get a rave? Whoo! - Deena, snooki, let's roll.
- Deena, let's go.
That was fun, dancing on the bar.
- Who would've thought the team fun would've been The meatballs and mike? - Yep.
- Yeah.
- We hate each other, then we love each other.
- Right now, I am keeping my friends close And my enemies closer.
- You've proved to me, like, you've been good.
You haven't even started anything.
- Proud of you! - I am proud of you to be honest with you.
- If you're nice to me, I'm nice to you.
You know what I mean? That's how I am.
But if you're mean to me, then I'm like the worst.
- You're a fun.
Both: You make me fun.
- Even though me and mike Have had problems and [bleep] like that, I mean, we can still like go out, drink, Just have a good time.
Both: We're all vivacious.
Vivacious.
- Flamboyant.
- Oh, oh, vivacious.
- "flambacious.
" - "flambacious"? - Yeah, we're team crazy pants.
- Me and pauly see roger at the gym.
Roger doesn't seem happy.
- Jenni's flipping, dude.
I'm not kissing her ass.
You gonna think I'm calling? You're gonna be waiting a long time for that phone to ring.
- Man, roger don't play around, does he? - You're a hit, lola.
And I had fun with you today.
Everyone loved you.
[cheering] All: Go, lola! Go, lola! - Oh, my god, I love vegas.
No one can handle you.
'cause you're from vegas.
She's an innocent girl, trying to make a living In this economy.
You look like a prostitute.
I love this bitch.
If you got a urinary tract infection, you talk to me.
Just saying.
- Settle down.
- [laughing] - Especially you, deena.
- Yo, deena, I heard you guys come in.
- Last night, we drank a lot.
We drank all through work.
We didn't even really work.
- Oh, did you get in trouble? - No.
- He's pissed.
- Really? - Whenever you guys took the dip, He said he never been so pissed in his whole entire life.
He's hurt that you would do that Because you guys came to some kind of agreement.
He's pissed.
- Yeah? I'm just like, "oh, my god.
" What if I get fired? Then I have to leave the house.
I don't want that to happen.
- Did them a solid by actually going to get them.
When they got back, they bounced on him.
- And he said to us too, He was like, "this is my business.
" He goes, "you gu don't care.
" he's like, "but I do.
" - Cool, I'm gonna get fired.
- You should go apologize to him today Before you get to work tomorrow.
I'm just saying.
That's what a respectable person would do.
- I should probably call him.
This is like the perfect job.
It's right underneath my house.
LikeI'd be stupid to, like, screw up this job.
[line trilling] - Hello.
- Hey, danny.
- Hey.
I'm sorry.
- Apology's not going to get you very far.
I'm pissed at you two.

Whoo! Who does that? - How is there a pretzel in my makeup? - I didn't do it.
- Who did? - Cool.
- Oh, yeah! Chinese food, yeah! Vinny, Sunday dinner! - Deena, did you ever find out How my brother and your sister's second date went? - They went on a second? - I'm gonna call my sister now.
- Deena's older sister and my older brother, It looks like they may get together.
And that means like I could become deena's brother-in-law? - So if our brother and sister get married, Will you guys come to the wedding? - And you saw your sister-in-law's vagina.
- You saw dina's vagina.
- Frank is such a nice kid, you know, And he's been in a relationship for like nine years.
And then deena's sister was his first date since-- - Smash? Oh.
- Smush? - Or probably that too.
- Don't talk about my sister like that.
Would you want me to talk about your family like that? I don't wanna embarrass her.
- Whoa, sorry.
- Yikes, change the subject.
- I think the second date probably went well.
I know the first one went well.
- No comment.
- Mike's being a [bleep], like, making fun of my sister.
I'm like, "yo, don't talk about my family.
" Get real! Who talks about my family like that? Not you, mike.
Enough.
- Deena, sister-in-law.
I think it's hilarious that I'm actually playing along Right now with deena being my sister-in-law.
Give your brother-in-law a hug.
- Oh! - Come here.
Aww.
But I'm really just doing it just to mess with her.
Oh, you-- nobody knows what you do.
[line trilling] Yo, what's up, [bleep]? - What up, homey? - What's up with frankie, my brother, And you know deena's sister? What's up with that? - I don't know, man.
I think um They did the damn thing.
And I don't know if they really-- I don't know.
- Oh, are you saying that-- So, uh, you're saying that, uh, he's trying to, you know, Smash and dash, you know what I'm saying? - [laughing] you're pretty perceptive, You know what I'm saying? - I am getting information that it's becoming the smash and dash With deena's sister.
I guess I gotta commend him and give him a pat on the back, man, 'cause, uh, you know, he's never been like that.
Really? [bleep] no.
He said that [bleep] had an awesome [bleep] first date.
- Who are you talking to? - Unit.
- About my sister and your brother? - Yeah, he knows what's up.
- Oh.
I am a little disappointed that my sister and frank Are still an item.
I don't know if I really would say I'm pleased With being in mike's family.
I mean, he's been nice so far, but A leopard never sheds its stripes.
- All right.
- That was a pretty good phone call.
Yo.

- No, he's a great guy.
I mean, I do wanna see him again.
I definitely do.
- How much do you guys talk? - Almost like every day, every other day.
- That's cool, but he just got out of a long relationship And stuff, so he possibly could have his guard up, possibly.
- Mm-hmm.
- At the same time, I know he likes you.
- All right, good.
No, I'm glad to hear that.
- No, only because I want things to work out between you guys.
I think it's kinda cute.
- Aww.
Thank you.
- I want it to continue to go on For me to find out some more dirt And have some more fun.
- All right, well, have a good night.
- Tell your sister that I spoke to you and that I'm very nice.
'cause she thinks I'm the devil.

I just think sometimes you can be devilish.
- Yes.
- Until he proves me wrong, I will always be on my toes when it comes to mike.
- How've you been? I haven't seen you.
- Ah, jenni's flipping, dude.
I'm not kissing her ass.
You know what I mean? - Me and pauly see roger at the gym, And, uh, roger doesn't seem happy.
- I don't play that game, bro.
Don't talk to me like a 15-year-old on the phone And think I'm gonna kiss your ass.
And then slams the phone down before I can say anything back.
You know what I mean? I'm not a little kid.
Don't talk to me like that.
- She can do that with the other one, not you.
- She wants to grow up, you know what I mean? Pick up the [bleep] phone.
But you're gonna think I'm calling? You're gonna be waiting a long time for that phone to ring.
- Right, right.
- I don't play that game, bro.
I'm good to my girl.
I treat her like gold.
If she's gonna act like I don't, sell that story somewhere else.
- I actually take roger's side, because roger's a cool guy.
He's an adult, he doesn't play games.
I know that jenni's just being stubborn, And she's gonna have to grow up and call roger back.
- You coming out tonight? - I don't know, man.
We'll see what's up.
- All right.
You know where we'll be at.
- All right, boys.
- Later.
Man, roger don't play around, does he? - Saw roger at the gym today.
- What'd he say? - Do I tell you? [laughing] He didn't say anything bad.
- What? - More like a message.
- What? - Nothing, I was like "where you been?" He's like, "just going at it with jenni a little bit.
" He's like, "you know, I'm not a little kid anymore.
You know what I mean? Waiting for the phone.
" Like you know, like-- Basically, said the usual roger thing, He's a mature guy - Now I need a cigarette.
- He doesn't want games and [bleep].
He just-- - I think you're being stupid not calling him.
- Yeah, you're being-- you should call him.
Like he's-- - all right.
I still think roger's in the wrong.
I'm gonna call him, all is forgiven, And we'll go out and have a good night.
[line trilling] - Hello? - SoI don't know, I just wanted to apologize For that phone call.
- First of all, I did nothing wrong.
I'm not apologizing for anything I did.
I'm good to you.
But you'd be sitting by that phone for a lifetime If you thought I was gonna call and kiss your ass.
The issue here is trust.
- All right.
- And I'm really pissed about it.
- Literally, I'm sucking up my pride, And all I wanna do is apologize and say I'm sorry.
- I would like to say my piece.
This has been building for a few weeks.
- But I didn't think you were honestly this mad at me.
- I am mad.
You said your piece and then you hung up like a coward.
Now I have the right to say my piece.
You do not trust me.
And that frankly, hurts me, first of all, And really pisses me off second of all.
Because I've earned it.
It's hypocrisy, jenni.
- Trust me.
Follow me out.
- Meatballs, where are you going? [Laughter] - You're kidding me.
- I've been looking for you all [Bleep] day! - I guess you'd have to say that Paula is my main squeeze right now.
The body on that girl, pbbboosh! Sheesh! - Where have you been, brah? I haven't seen you.
- Eh, Jenny's flipping, dude.
- Me and pauly see Roger at the gym.
Roger doesn't seem happy.
- If you don't stop with these insecurities and start trusting me, jenni, we are going to be damned.
We're going to be done.
We're going to be ruined.
[Get crazy by lmfao] - Dj pauly delvecchio! - I'm going to Jersey shore, bitch! - All right, we got a situation.
- I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
- [Laughing] - After I have sex with a guy, I will rip their heads off.
- Go, vinny! Go, vinny! - Do you like the boobs? - You do not trust me, and that, frankly hurts me, first of all.
And really pisses me off, second of all.
Because I trust you emphatically, but you don't trust me in the slightest.
So what is it gonna be? - I'm just, I mean Jesus [Bleep], I didn't think this was gonna be that type of call.
- So what's it gonna be, jenni? - I don't know.
- Don't tell me, "I don't know.
" That's, like, a 15-year-old thing to say.
Where do we stand? - I don't know what to tell you.
- You want to leave it like that? That's how you want to leave it? - I just thought the apology was gonna be okay, and I just don't know what to say.
- I need to know where we're gonna go from here.
What is it gonna be? - I was prepared for a small apology, a "I love you," mwah, mwah, mwah type of conversation, and holy [Bleep], am I in the wrong.
- I don't understand who [Bleep] you over so bad in your past that I'm paying for it, but I love you.
I don't want to be with anybody else.
I wanna be with you.
Trust me.
- I wasn't looking at Roger's side of things.
I was just looking at my spoiled, rotten ass's side.
- I'm asking you, what do you want to do? - D like to stay with you.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
- Let's put this behind us.
I said everything I had to say.
Um, I'm glad that we could be adults about this.
Sorry for raising my voice.
- Yeah, my ass is bleeding, but I'm cool.
- Well, mine was bleeding a little the other day too.
So - All right.
- All right, babe.
I love you.
- Love you.
Bye now.
- Bye.
- I'm really glad that I called Roger and we squared off, 'cause I could have lost him as a boyfriend 'cause I didn't realize how mad he was.
I just thought it was like a stupid little fight.
- Did you speak to rog? - Yeah, I got my ass reamed out.
- What did he say? - He was like, "you change plans on me all day, "and then I take all these days off of work for you, and the one day I take off, you went postal.
" He goes, "I can't help that I was running late, "but if you really wanted to see me, you'd see me.
" - Oh, he was just running late with that day? - Yeah.
- Oh, you're an idiot.
- Yeah, I thought he was cancelling on you.
- Roger's like, you know, like, 65 years old, so he's not going to be playing all these baby games that, like, she did with tom.
I think, like, she kind of overreacted.
You were just being a little brat.
- Yeah.
[Electronica playing] - We've got work in the morning.
- Yeah.
- I can't believe you [Bleep] didn't go back to your shift.
- We got drunk.
That's why.
- Let's go to ej's.
- Okay.
- You're kidding me.
- Oh, God.
Danny's gonna yell at me.
- He's like, "tell the meatballs-- I don't know.
I'll handle it.
" - Danny's, like, upset because me and my other meatball took off, and I'm just like, "oh, my God, I feel really bad.
" - It's like a disappointed father.
- Maybe I'll bring him, like, a bagel or something.
- Do something, though.
- Yeah.
- Not a bagel.
We have to do something.
- Oh.
- What can you bring him? - Bake him a cake.
- Yeah, bake him a cake.
Like, "we're sorry, Danny.
" - I'm gonna bake him a cake.
- You should make him a cake.
- Team meatballs.
- My mission is to, like, make this cake and him really take it as an apology.
We're putting some meatball love into this cake.
Get the spoon.
- We make the batter or whatever.
We put it in the pan.
And after all is said and done, this is gonna be an amazing cake.
- You should have put hot dogs in that cake.
- How long do we keep it in there for? - 65 minutes.
- Cool.
- Really? Did you even look at the time? - Oh, God, did we put it in for too long? - Did you look at the time you were supposed to start it? - We keep checking on it.
- Oh, my God.
- Keep checking on it.
- We didn't even put it in.
[Laughter] - Are you kidding me right now? [Laughter] - Are you kidding me? - That's a meatball problem right there.
[Laughter] [Guitar music] - Oh, my God, it's hot.
Ow, you [Bleep].
- We are putting icing on it.
We're drawing our little meatball selves on it with Danny in the middle, holding hands.
And I think Danny's gonna love this cake.
I'm proud of us, Nicole.
- Me too.
And you know what? We knew it was wrong, and we did it anyway like ass[Bleep].
- I know.
- So, whatever.
- And then we just lost track of time.
I have to be honest, I forgot we were even at work after a while.
- Uh, me too, so - Good night, Ron.
You going to bed? - Yep.
- "Danny, we're sorry.
We love you.
Love, the meatballs.
" - Cute.
- Time to go to work.
- Oh, my God.
- I think there's a mouse in the house.
- What do you mean? What happened? - Who ate the [Bleep] cake? - [Laughs] - I'm actually guilty in this house until proven innocent.
- Was he part of the cake making? - No, but he was up when we went to sleep.
- I'm taking Nicole to the doctor.
Rectal bleeding? - No, I don't have rectal bleeding.
- Who ate the [Bleep] cake? Are you fricking kidding me? Who fricking eats a piece of cake when you know it's an "I'm sorry" cake? - This looks cute.
- [Bleep] Mike ate the [Bleep] cake.
- Mike? No.
- Pauly? - Who loves chocolate cake? - No, it was you, Ron.
- Why would I eat cake? - Pauly was sleeping.
- Maybe Mike, then.
- Mike is the prime suspect, because he was the last person up, so I was like, you know what? Mike ate this frickin' cake.
Who does that? No, like, really, though? That, like, really does tick me off.
- Pauly, yo, how was that chocolate cake? Was it good? - No.
- Oh, you didn't eat it? - Nicole, somebody ate our [Bleep] cake.
- Hey, let's go.
- Was it you? - It wasn't pauly.
- No, it wasn't pauly.
- He was sleeping.
- It was Mike.
It was Mike.
- I know who it was.
- It was Mike.
- That so pisses me off.
[Electronica playing] - Good morning.
- Morning, Ronnie.
Morning, Sammi.
- I'll do it.
- This is for you.
Me and Nicole made it, but frickin' Mike ate it.
It was supposed to say, "love, the meatballs.
" - Very cute.
- I'm really disappointed at giving Danny this half-eaten cake.
I wanted him to get the full-on cake.
- It's very cute.
[Phone ringing] - Silver bay medical.
This is Jamie.
How may I help you? - Um, I, like, have a uti and it really hurts.
- Okay, I have a walk-in till 4:00.
- Okay, cool.
- All right, thank you.
- Thanks, bye.
That was awkward.
Poop.
Is Mike here? - Why? - I heard he ate our cake.
- Dude, what a [Bleep].
- I'm gonna punch him.
I should go to the doctor.
- Ready when you are.
[Rock music] - I'm taking Nicole to the doctor.
She's been hurting for the past couple of days, and she can finally see if there's actually something wrong with her.
This should be good.
[Electronica] - $70 altogether.
- All right, you guys.
You're on break.
- I'm getting my sleeve airbrushed.
Can I get, like, this covered with airbrush? - Sure.
[Rap music playing] - I wanted to see what I'd look like with a tattoo on my arm.
I think it's a good time.
It's, like, fun.
- Cool.
Thank you.
I got a sleeve.
- Oh, [Bleep].
- That looks awesome.
- Right now I feel really mad whore with this sleeve.
Nobody better mess with me because I'm tough.
- Want a little piece? - You're eating it? - Yeah.
Have a little piece, everybody.
Cake party.
- It's got a weird smell, like, taste to it.
Like, when you cut into it, it's, like, weird.
- Really? - Yeah.
- Oh! [Laughter] - Now we're even.
- I hate you.
- Now we're even.
[Laughter] - All right, Danny.
It's on, bitch.
[Upbeat music] - Have a seat, and we'll come in and give you some stuff.
- All right.
My symptoms.
- Rectal bleeding.
- No, I don't have rectal bleeding.
- What's going on? - Um, I think I have a uti.
I've gotten them before, like, probably, like, ten times in the last year.
- For now, we should be able to get you better with, you know, just the antibiotic.
Let's check you out and see.
- So I don't drink on that, right? - Yeah, you should take it easy.
- How are you gonna have fun at the shore without drinking? Say I only wanted, like, one drink.
- That's fine.
You could do that.
- Okay.
Thank God.
It was gonna be so hard not to drink tonight.
I'll get a nice, big strong one.
- Guess I'm going to work solo.
- The other ones are late, huh? - I guess they could have planned it out.
Who knows? All right, [Bleep].
Off I go to work.
Uh, Nicole is m.
I.
A.
As well as jenni right now, so I'm going by myself.
What up, man? - What's up, brah? How are we doing, man? - Good.
- Where's your counterparts at? - I have no idea.
I waited for them at the crib for a little bit.
They didn't show, so I rolled.
- After all the [Bleep] Nicole said about it all to deena.
"We're so sorry we drank.
We'll be so good.
" They already don't show up.
- Yeah, I don't know what to tell you.
I mean-- - looks like you're gonna be not the bottom ringer this year.
- Yeah, for sure.
- You already got two others.
- Sure, I'm here, man.
I wasn't totally, like, running them over with the bus, but I was definitely, you know, telling Danny, "I don't know where they are.
I mean, they should be here.
" [Phone ringing] - Hello? - Hey, what's up? This is Danny.
- What's up, bro? - Not much, man.
I'm just trying to find out where the girls are.
- I know that this time she was at the doctor.
- Pardon? - 'Cause she has a urinary tract infection.
- Who? Nicole does? - Yeah.
- Oh.
- But she went a while ago, so we were expecting her to be back now.
- [Sighs] This sucks.
You know, not even a phone call or anything.
All right, man.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
- He's pissed? I thought they would have called him.
- Well he said, he goes, "I didn't get a phone call or anything.
" - Are you kidding me? - Yeah.
[Rock music] - Maybe we should have called Danny.
- What do you mean? - To say we were going to the doctor's, and we might be a little late.
- [Bleep] Happens.
- We didn't know it was gonna take that long also.
- You girls have some nerve.
- We have doctor notes.
- Doctor notes? [Bleep].
- Did you like our cake? - Happy about that.
- Love you.
- No, you don't.
You hate my guts.
- Yes, I do.
I'm sorry.
- No, she felt really bad today.
They baked you a cake last night.
We were gonna get balloons.
- And then she showed up an hour late.
- Well, we went to the hospital-- or the doctor's, at 3:30.
We didn't know it was gonna take two hours.
Danny, you know, he wasn't that mad at me.
He's like, "whatever.
" But I know there's some punishment coming.
- Bring all these boxes into the shed.
[Rock music] - I have to pick up all the [Bleep] heavy boxes Ow! Put 'em in the shed, and then do this, do that.
See any clothes I'd like? Ooh, what's this? Shorts? Windex this, do this, and I'm like, oh, my God.
This is frickin' retail abuse.
I'm too pretty for this [Bleep].
- Teamwork, boo.
[Rock music playing] - [Groans] - What's wrong with you? - Just tired.
- Did you eat the cake? - No, I-- - who do you think ate the cake? - I don't eat cake.
- Everyone's saying it's you in the house.
- Did I eat the cake? Holy [Bleep].
Did I eat the cake? [Laughs] - Who ate the cake? I want to know.
- Just be honest, man.
- I know, I'm honest.
- Come clean.
- I would say if I ate the cake.
- "I had some cake.
" - I love the fact that I'm the one that ate the cake.
I'm the unanimous decision that I ate the cake.
It's unanimous, but I had nothing to do with it.
I'm actually guilty in this house until proven innocent, so if anything goes wrong in this house, the situation did it.
- Was he part of the cake making? - No, but he was up when we went to sleep.
- Yeah, there you go.
Everyone but him knew that the cake was being made.
Mike always is the instigator.
He's always the one that's doing sneaky [Bleep], so Mike is our number one suspect.
- So, dude, did you really eat my cake? - I actually am on a diet, so it cannot even be me.
- That's hilarious.
[Electronica playing] - Deena, come here.
- What? - Hmm.
When you went to bed last night, I smelled the cake and I couldn't take it.
- It was you! It was you! - I had to take a bite of the cake.
I had to take a bite of the cake.
- You! - I couldn't help it! I couldn't help it! The second I heard deena go to sleep, I tiptoed right into the kitchen, got myself a spoon, and I ate myself a piece of that cake.
Don't cook a cake in my house and expect me not to eat it.
- It was you! - I couldn't help it! - I've been so mad at Mike all day.
All day! I feel kind of bad that I blamed Mike the entire time for the cake.
It's like the kid really does get blamed for everything.
[Overlapping chatter] - Nice arm.
Look at that [Bleep].
- Listen to this.
So I come up this morning and there's a little piece of cake missing, and I was like, "Mike! [Bleep] Mike ate the cake!" Like, I thought, 'cause everybody else was asleep and you, like, ate the cake.
- I--do you know I'm on a diet? - It was pauly that ate the cake.
- Everybody blamed me.
I was blamed.
- For the cake.
- Blamed for the [Bleep] cake, and I'm on a diet.
- I apologize for that.
- The roommates definitely piss me off.
I get blamed for everything.
I've been good the whole time.
Like, they'd only notice if I was bad, so I feel like the mean Mike is about to come out, and you're not gonna like it.
I always pick you over everybody.
- You do.
It makes me feel special.
- I can't think of anything wrong.
It's almost too good to be true.
- I just want to see deena and Joey have sex.
I mean, I'm bored.
- I was blamed for the [Bleep] cake, and I'm on a diet.
- I apologize for that.
- I get blamed for everything.
I've been good the whole time.
Like, they'd only notice if I was bad.
What time you coming through tonight? - Try to time it up for like 11:00-11:30.
- Where's unit at? - I think he's still in Florida.
- He didn't--he didn't get home yet? - Nah, I think they're coming home tomorrow morning, he said.
- All right, all right, all right, all right.
If he's coming home tomorrow, whatever.
- Is that cool? You still want me to come out there? - Yeah, of course I want you to come out here, you know what I mean? I've at least got to have one of my friends out in the [Bleep] battle zone.
You know what I mean? - Yeah.
- All right, brother.
Come through and do what you gotta do, and I guess I'll see you, um, around 11:30.
- 11:00-11:30.
- All right, no doubt.
- Later, brother.
- Peace.
[Bleep], [Bleep].
Looks like the master plan was derailed for another night.
It was supposed to be tonight.
Deena, where are we going? Karma tonight? - I guess.
I'm going to karma tonight.
Let's get this night started.
[Hip-hop music playing] - [Groans] I look like a Jersey skank, and I love it.
- Roll out.
Roll out.
We have business to go do.
- [Laughs] - It's like, you know what I mean? We're going to work.
- [Laughs] - Like, we punch in.
My shift starts as soon as I walk into karma.
- I'm trying to get laid tonight.
- I put in work.
- I'm a player.
- You work mad whore.
- I'm the player of the month.
- [Laughs] [Electronica playing] - What's going on? - What's up, bro? - You get a haircut? - How the hell are you, you big monkey? - It's my birthday in, like, five minutes.
- It's her birthday! - It's your birthday? - In, like, five minutes.
- Paula's like, "it's my birthday," so right then and there, jenni is like, "shots!" Here comes the shots and this is where it sucks.
- Happy Birthday! - Whoo! - Happy Birthday, Paula! - My doctor said that I can't really drink a lot, but I knew it was gonna be so hard not to drink, so you know what? I just gave in and I drank and I drank Long island.
And I drank.
Honestly, I drank so much that my frickin' uti was drunk, so now I know he's happy, I'm happy, everybody's happy.
- What's today? What's today? What's today? - Your birthday.
- Yes, it is.
- I see Paula and, like, she's looking good.
For her birthday, we definitely smash.
- Time to go! Everybody out! [Overlapping chatter] - Tell me if I have camel-toe! - If it's your birthday, you're allowed to have camel-toe, Paula.
- Stop it! Let me down! - If it was my birthday, I would have camel-toe too.
You feel me? Yeah, buddy.
Yeah, buddy.
Birthday sex.
- Are you actually gonna give her birthday sex now? - Yes, she is getting birthday sex.
- [Laughs] - Man, you better give it to me.
- Oh, you better give it to her, bro.
[Guitar music] - Let's go see the waves upstairs be romantic.
Guess you'd have to say that Paula is my main squeeze right now.
She's definitely very, very cute.
Very, very sexy body.
Cool personality.
Like, I can't think of anything wrong.
It's almost too good to be true.
So three years in the making, we finally had a real date.
- Three years.
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't know what that says, but-- [laughter] - I always pick you over everybody.
- You do.
It makes me feel special.
- Mm-hmm.
- You know how to make me feel like the only girl in a room with a million girls in it.
- Mm-hmm.
All right, come on, let's go.
It's definitely hard for me to settle down, and I'm very, very picky when it comes to girlfriends, but me and Paula have been hanging out a lot and getting along very well, so who knows? Don't fall now.
- Watch your mouth.
- [Laughs] Good night.
- I hope you can keep up with me.
- I don't know.
I don't think you can keep up with me.
- Oh, don't try to threaten me with a challenge.
[Overlapping chatter] - Ronnie's wasted.
[Laughter] Oh, my God.
- Yo, jwoww.
- This guy is grabbing me and Roger is like, "yo, back off.
" - Nicole? - Hmm? - We have work.
- Already? - I know, right? - Did you have a good birthday? - I got my birthday sex.
- Good for you.
- [Laughs] - I actually really like Paula, and I think Mike likes Paula.
Truthfully, deep down, I think he does.
Can we go to work? Let's go.
- Cool.
- Gotta go to work.
- This is the hottest walk of shame I've ever seen.
- We just completed a trifecta-- gym, tan, and laundry.
Now take me to lunch, bitch.
- It's on fisher, right? - Don't tell me where it's at, bro.
I'm gonna tell you where it's at, [Bleep].
I put up with a lot of [Bleep] being with you.
- I'm definitely not breaking up with pauly.
We're in a committed relationship, and me andauly are gonna take this thing to the next level forever.
- Take a left.
- That's [Bleep] sad.
- [Laughs] Yep, vinny's my dude.
We're like the meatballs, except we're not meatballs.
[Upbeat music] - $23.
40.
- Yeah, I'm gonna pay for this bitch here.
- Wow.
You're taking me to lunch.
- How cute.
- Me and vinny going to muscle maker, it is definitely a date.
- Hopefully I get it in later.
- I paid for his dry cleaning this morning.
- You guys are gonna smush? Watch out.
Behave.
- All right.
We won't.
- [Laughs] You won't.
Bye, guys.
See ya later.
- Lost our keys.
I'm a little bit of a putz sometimes with my keys and cannot find them right now, so I'm looking all over muscle maker to see where I dropped 'em.
They have to be here.
I mean, I friggin' drove here, right? Always losin' stuff.
- Look, here they are on the ground, right here.
I can't--I can't let this guy drive anymore.
- I was telling you.
Bye.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
- This is why I don't let my man vinny drive.
Like, you only have one job.
Hold on to the keys when you're driving.
He couldn't even do that.
Make a left.
- Left? [Bleep] That.
- [Laughs] [Electronica] [Phone ringing] - Hello? - Yeah? - Yeah, what's up? - Nothin'.
So you'll be at jenks? - Yeah, I'm gonna go there.
You goin'? - Yeah.
- All right.
What time you goin'? - We'll probably be there around 11:00.
- All right, yeah.
I'm gonna go with my brother and a few of my friends.
- All right, cool.
So I'll see you there.
- All right.
- All right, bye.
Tonight, I'm so excited to go to jenks.
Joey's meeting us there.
Me and him have hooked up before.
To have him come to the house would just be phenomenal.
- I'm not going, then.
You know, I'll just stay here, whatever.
- What are you gonna do? - I'll entertain myself.
- [Bleep] Pop? - Probably.
Maybe I'll clean the house.
Pbbbt! That was a joke.
- I don't know what's going oz in this house.
Snooki doesn't want to go to jenks.
She said it's gonna get boring.
J-yawn's sleeping away.
We got situation, snoring away.
I don't know what's in the friggin' water in this house, but it's not affecting me.
- Ready? - Yeah, let's go.
- Love you.
What you drinking? You can't do that.
Oh, cool.
- Thank you.
- Cool! I just got a party drink.
[Door slams] - Next stop, jenkinson's.
- I just want to say I'm really happy that we're doing something different tonight.
- Me too, bro.
[Electronica playing] - We're here already? This is awesome.
[Cheering] - We get to jenks tonight, and there's people everywhere.
The music's jumping, the drinks are flowing, and everyone's just ready to have a good time.
[Cheering] I'm hearing the music, and my feet just start going.
I got gumby ankles.
You don't want those.
- Oh! - Oh, my God.
Like, Ronnie is wasted, and I'm loving every second of it.
I'm just like, this is so funny.
I'm, like, giving myself a cramp from laughing so hard.
- Mike.
- Yes? - Let's go to jimbo's.
This is Lola.
- Where's your-- where's your drink? There's your hat.
- This is Lola.
- I thought of a good idea.
- What? She's a prostitute from Vegas, and she'll do anything.
- Did you-- [Laughs] Did you ever see, um, varsity blues? - Yes.
- Where they just pour, like, whipped cream on each other and then they just have whipped cream on it and they're drunk? We should do that.
- Mike, I want to go out.
- [Laughs] That's fun.
I'll put just whipped cream on it, you just put whipped cream on, and we could be drunk.
That'd be real fun.
- Mike, no.
- Okay.
I'm definitely flirting with her right now, and I'm just gonna push the envelope until she bends.
Or [Bleep].
One or the other.
- It's like 12 to 10:00.
We should go somewhere.
- Where do you want to go? - What's 12 to 10 mean? - 12 minutes to 10:00? - Yeah.
What's that mean? - I think that means ten minutes to 12:00.
- Really? - Mm-hmm.
- Oh, so I said it right.
- Mm-mm.
- I have no idea how to speak clock language, so when I say, "hi, what time is it?" And somebody says, "a quarter past 2:00," just say it's, [Bleep], like 2:30.
It's still early.
- Um, we can get really drunk and, um, we can get my furry handcuffs out.
- I don't understand why Mike has to be such a creep and try and, like, get with me or whatever.
All he's thinking about is, like, sex and hooking up.
- I'm kind of horny right now.
That's really all I want to do.
- I can't deal with you.
- Can you just wear the furry boots when you come back? - Oh, dear [Bleep].
Jenni, let's go do something.
- [Laughs] She likes it.
She's just playing around.
- You're gonna get lipstick on you.
Me and Joey hooked up before.
- Are you gonna do sex? - Can I watch? - You're coming down here tonight, right? Nicole is definitely not off the hook.
I will not be made out to be a liar.
It's gonna be a wild night, then.
Mm-hmm.
- Cheers! I'm having a blast here.
Joey's here, and we're, like, excited, and I'm like, mmm, yum! Did you miss me? - The whole week I haven't seen you? - Yeah.
- How about you? Did you miss me? You're, like, high on life.
That's why I like you.
- That's why I like you.
- What? - 'Cause you're like me.
- High on life? - Joey definitely seems like he's into me, and I really like Joey's personality.
He has that nice guy, but a bit of a [Bleep] at the same time, which I'm into.
Who knows? Maybe this could be a start of a good thing.
You're gonna get lipstick on you.
- I got chapstick.
- No.
You're gonna get lipstick on you.
Merp.
- All right, let's go.
- You're coming home, right? - Everyone wants to go.
What do you want to do? - We'll hang out at the house.
- I'm gonna get a little popcorn.
- I'm gonna sleep.
- You gonna go to bed? - Wanna smoke really quick? - Yeah, buddy.
The second I get in the house from jenks, I know deena is gonna come home with a dude, but I am going to set her up like I used to do.
I'm taking disgusting plates that are in the kitchen-- one that has all the cookie residue and putting that on her bed.
I'm putting the blender on her bed.
I'm putting the dirty bowls on her bed.
She's gonna need protein for all that sex she's about to have.
I'm gonna leave her a nice little spread.
That should do it.
[Playful music] - I'm gonna change first.
I'm gonna change.
Yeah, right.
What the [Bleep] is this? Get real with this [Bleep].
Come on.
What the hell, people? Who put this in my bed? You get the [Bleep] cookie, 'cause I know you did it.
- I just got home.
- Get real.
Pauly.
You didn't put that in my bed? - No.
- Then who put it in my bed? You're mad at me? - [Mouthing words] - Stupid ass.
- I flipped the script on her, laid down the guilt trip, and now she's trying to apologize to me and ask why I'm mad at her.
[Laughs] Deena is super gullible, and I love it.
- Freakin' hell.
- Cool.
- Deena and Joey are up, and I'm like, oh, people to [Bleep] with.
Are you gonna do sex? - Who? Can I watch? - There's a smush room.
- Who is this character? Who is this? - Joey.
Nice to meet you.
- That's Dee's man.
- Who? - The one she likes.
- Oh.
- The one she talks about.
- Oh! You're here.
Whoo! I have no idea what I'm talking about.
I'm not thinking.
I'm just talking.
She likes you a lot, so if you [Bleep] her over, we will kill you.
You be nice to her.
- I am nice to her.
- He's blushing.
- Do you have a condom? - Nah.
- Do you have a condom? - Nah.
- What do you mean, "nah"? - I don't have one.
- Pauly! - Pauly! - Really? - Yeah, 100%.
- What's wrong with you? - I didn't--I--I didn't even know I was coming back tonight.
- Uh, you're annoying.
Do you have a condom? Do you have a condom? It's for deena.
You need to say you didn't get it from us.
- Oh, my God.
You're killing this kid right now.
I feel bad for him right now.
- Ehh, ehh, ehh, merp, merp, mer-- - welp, merp.
That's how she finishes off.
Merp, and everything, and that's all.
[Snoring] [Laughter] - So did you hook up with any other guys that I know? - I don't do sex with randoms.
Even though I did sex with you.
But you're not a random.
I really like you.
- Can we go watch? - Give it five minutes, 'cause it just got awkward.
- Okay.
I just want to see deena and Joey have sex.
I mean, I'm bored.
- Huh! - Just kidding! Love you.
- Merp.
- I'm all ready for Roger to come, 'cause the last thing he expects is for me to be answering the door in this outfit.
- Can you tell us your spiel right now? What you're supposed to say at the table? - I'll walk up like I'm taking you guys' order.
- We're having family dinner, and we're all eating at this table, and I'm like this is the perfect time to bomb them with a grenade balloon.
- All right, well, just to let you all know-- - do you have any specials? - I will get to that.
- [Blowing raspberry] [Laughter] [Overlapping chatter] - Just to let you all know-- [All scream] - Who is that? - Oh, my sneakers! - Remember when we were ten time felt like it had no end - I wake up this morning, and it's like a great feeling.
Like, I'm like, yay.
Like, I haven't had this feeling in a while.
[Dialing phone number] [Phone ringing] - Hi, um, can I have a taxi to 1200 ocean terrace? - How many people? - Just one.
Thanks.
- Thanks.
- I call a cab for Joey, and I'm like, merrr.
I really like you.
I don't want you to leave yet.
- [Groans] - Cab's here.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Okay, okay.
- Call me later.
- All right.
- Wow, he's so cute.
I actually think deena loves Joey.
You can fall in love at the Jersey shore.
You never know what can happen.
I've got to get myself together now.
- What are you doing over there on the "get ready" couch? - Nothing.
I think I pulled my back.
- Yikes.
It's all that Jersey turnpiking, grrrr.
- I don't know if my back hurts from, you know, giving out my golden ticket, or from Jersey turnpiking so much.
Joey may have banged my back out of alignment.
He's, you know, good in bed.
- Does this mean your years of Jersey turnpiking are over? - No.
Oh, my God.
- Yo, if you hurt your back Jersey turnpiking, that's deena problems, and I love it.
[Laughs] - [Groans] Oh, God.
I don't remember.
- Look, I'm gonna stretch you out.
Ready? - Oh.
Eh.
What? - Oh, it stinks over here.
- Shut up.
- [Laughs] - [Bleep], vin.
- [Laughs] - [Bleep].
[Groans] - You drive.
Driving? [Upbeat music playing] [Dial tone] [Dialing phone number] [Phone ringing] - Yo.
- Yo, what up? - What's crack-a-lackin'? - No--nothing, man.
Coming down here tonight, right? - Yeah.
Hell yeah.
Hell yeah.
- Cool, cool, cool.
Um - How's everything going? Any more ruckuses? - No, no.
I didn't, um, I didn't do anything yet.
- You're--you're--you're-- you're waiting.
- Yeah, I waited, 'cause I didn't see that person either.
Nicole is definitely not off the hook.
We need to let jionni know, hey, snooki really did cheat on you.
I will not be made out to be a liar.
I think Saturday night's the night everybody goes out and sees each other, so it's gonna be a wild night, then.
- Mm-hmm.
- You know what I mean? - Yeah.
- Peace.
- Peace.
- You know what? In a way, I--I actually do owe jionni the truth.
I feel bad that every time he's kissing his girl, he's like, you know, kissing my, you know, ehh.
- Cool.
Pretty.
- I am wearing this outfit tonight for Roger to know that there are tww big reasons why he is still with me.
- Boing.
Jenni's showing me this outfit that she wants to wear to karma.
It doesn't show, you know-- well, it does show everything, but I feel like it doesn't cover anything.
That's the jwoww we love.
It's about frickin' time.
Your ass cheeks are out.
- I'm all ready for Roger to come, 'cause the last thing he expects is for me to be answering the door in this outfit.
- Coming.
[Duck phone quacks] - Hey.
Holy crap.
- Hi.
- Hi, babe.
How are you? [Duck phone quacks] - Good.
How are you.
The [Bleep] duck, man.
- I like the outfit or lack thereof.
- All the fighting and drama with Roger and getting my ass chewed out over the phone is worth it for this moment, opening the door and seeing Roger's face.
- You seen my girlfriend? I haven't seen her in a few days.
- [Laughs] Yeah, I haven't seen my boyfriend either.
- Is this the real you or the psycho that called me the other day? [Laughter] I like your outfit.
Holy crap.
- Yeah, I bought it when I was angry at you.
- Oh, yeah? You were gonna go, like, wear that out? - Huh? - What'd you make that out of? Like, a handkerchief? - And some thread.
I'm just dying inside, 'cause I know Roger loves it but he's also probably very concerned for tonight.
He probably doesn't want to get in a fight or an argument with all the guys gawking, which I can't wait for.
I thought if I didn't call, I would see you there tonight.
- You rockin' that and have every swingin' [Bleep] In the place on you? Good idea, good idea.
- No.
- Let's have fun tonight and put all that [Bleep] behind us.
I just know I wasn't calling to kiss your ass.
I know that.
- Cabs are here.
- Cabs are here.
- Cab's here.
- Cabs are here.
- Don't let a boob slip.
[Dance music] - Karma is crazy, crazy, crazy.
I've never seen it this crazy.
Like, it's insane.
[Overlapping shouts] [Cheering] - That was good.
- Yo, that--that one chick was teeing off on the girl that was getting held down.
- I was avoiding it.
I'm like this.
My boobs.
My boobs.
- Hey, get 'em up here.
- Salud! - Salud! - Cheers! - I just want to get a shirt.
- For? A shirt? - In case I fight.
I want to throw on a shirt.
- Jenni, you're not fighting.
- What if someone swings? - Nobody's gonna-- then I'm punching.
Don't worry about it.
Don't fight.
Jenni, don't fight.
- Karma is packed tonight and I don't feel comfortable.
Like, all this crazy [Bleep] is happening, and I'm so paranoid that this dress is gonna snap and my boobs are gonna come popping out.
- Baby, let's get out of here.
I'm not dancing to bon jovi.
Come on.
- Let's go over here.
- Yo, jwoww! It's no time to leave.
- This guy is non-stop grabbing me and pulls down my dress a little bit.
And then Roger's like, "yo, back off.
" - Take a walk, bro.
- Really? - Yeah, really.
- Stop! Stop! 
I don't understand why Mike has to be such a creep.
All he's thinking about is, like, sex and hooking up.
- Oh, my God.
Where did she come from? - There's this girl.
She is the stalker of all stalkers.
I'm scared.
- I love you.
I don't want to be with anybody else.
- I am wearing this outfit tonight For Roger to know that there are two big reasons Why he is still with me.
Adriano_CSI LOL - I'm going to Jersey shore, bitch! - All right, we got a situation.
- I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
- [laughing] - After I have sex with a guy, I will rip their heads off.
- Go, vinny! Go, vinny! - You like the boobs? - Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
- The music's playing.
The drinks are flowing.
And all of a sudden, like, you just, like, felt the-- The tussling and people getting pushed.
[overlapping shouting] - Yo, jwoww.
It's not time to leave.
- This guy is nonstop grabbing me And pulls down my dress a little bit.
And then Roger's like, "yo, back off.
" - Take a walk, bro.
- Really? - Yeah, really.
- Stop! Stop! - I don't know what's going on in this guy's head right now.
You keep it moving.
You don't want to fight withoger.
- Babe, stop! - At karma, you can either Walk out the door or get thrown out the door.
I mean, you don't mess with Roger's girl.
That's karma for you.
Karma's a bitch.
[laughs] - I got vinny.
Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.
- Tonight didn't end on a really good note, But it was definitely time to leave.
Roger laid some dude out.
- Vinny, get in.
- Going home.
[rock music] [vinny speaking italian] - I have to eat something.
- Babe, but we're going to bed right now.
- [scoffs] - We're not hanging out.
We're going to bed.
I'm gonna get it in tonight, because I haven't seen jionni In, like, a week, and I'm really excited To just, you know-- to touch his [bleep] And make out with him and get it in.
- I have to throw up first.
I'll brush my teeth, I promise.
- [gags] - I'm a little thirsty, hungry.
See what we got.
We got probably a little bit of carrot to slice up.
There's even some celery to slice up.
And there better be some mother[bleep] Mayo.
- Here I'm fine.
I have to-- I really have to throw up.
[door closes] [vomiting] - Jionni I'm waiting.
Ugh, it smells like throw-up.
Honestly, you know, jionni's sick.
Whatever, like, I feel bad.
But I wanna [bleep] get it in with my boyfriend.
So why the [bleep] are you puking right now? Let's have sex.
[kicks door weakly] - [vomits] - Ew.
I'm gonna throw up.
[gags] - Grab the blankets.
- I'm waiting on you.
- Every time Roger comes over with jenni, As soon as they get home, like, she drags him to the smush room.
Like, the guy really doesn't get to hang out.
What are you doing? You sleeping already? - No, I'm waiting on-- my girl had to poop.
I had to wait.
We drinking? You want to drink? - Yeah, let's go.
- Let's go.
- Can I have a drink with Ronnie, baby? I have to ask permission.
Otherwise I won't get lked to for three days.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna have a drink with my friend half pint.
Have you met half pint? - [laughs] - Have you-- - is this me? What is this thing? - That was my haircut in Italy.
Who cares? [laughter] - Yo, big rog, I'm making a chicken salad sandwich.
Would you like some? - Oh, bro, yeah.
- I like chicken.
- Okay.
- [sighs] you gotta be [bleep] kidding me.
All I want to do right now Is spoon Roger in the smush room, And he's hanging out on the patio with my roommates.
And I'm like, "all right, that's cool for five, ten minutes.
"don't make a [bleep] night of it, "because I'm about to pass out, And I'd like to smush tonight.
" - No.
- My man right there.
Thank you, sir.
This ought to fill my small toe right here.
- It's the smallest sandwich I've ever seen.
- You look like you're eating a wheat thin.
- How many bites is that? - That's two bites.
- Babe! - Yo, big rog, I know you a big dog.
If you want another one, there's extra if you want one.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll do it.
- All right.
- [bleep].
- Good look, man.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, I get a pickle too.
- I thought gorillas only ate bananas.
- Dude, I'm a grown man.
You got at least six inches to go.
- Babe [babbling incoherently] - Mike's making food, babe.
Can I eat and then come up? Babe, come down and hang out.
Baby, come down.
- Do you see that? - Babe, what are you doing? I got food coming.
Jenni! - You are in so much trouble.
I love it right now.
- Yeah, I'm in deep [bleep], seriously.
I gotta eat this sandwich, then I need to go.
- You know, you gotta give Roger a break, you know? Viagra takes at least three hours to kick in, jenni, So he's not gonna be able to smush as soon as he gets home.
That's why he's having a drink downstairs, Eating a Turkey burger, You know, trying to kill some time.
- I'm gonna get hit in the head, seriously.
- You're whipped.
- I am.
I'm actually in love.
- With your sandwich.
[laughter] your curfew's in a little bit.
- It was a rough last three days, bro.
Don't even get me started.
- I heard about it.
I'm on your side, though.
- Well, I did nothing wrong.
- I feel like, if my girlfriend complained as much as she did, I'd probably lose my phone too.
[laughing] - Welcome to my world, my friend.
Welcome to my world.
- Oh! - What the [bleep]? - Baby, come on.
- Wow.
- Obviously someone's not getting laid tonight.
- She thought I was gonna, like, call and kiss her ass.
That ain't happening.
All right, I gotta go up before I get my ass kicked.
[laughter] Look, my bed.
Look, it's my bed.
Do you want to change or no? Okay.
Jionni's wasted right now, but I feel like, "I never see you.
Let's just [bleep] bang it out.
" Are you [bleep] sleeping? - [groans softly] - What the [bleep]? Turn around.
Come on, are you kidding me? What are you gonna do, [bleep] stay here And [bleep] snore in my ear all night? - I'm sleeping.
- Cool.
- Wow, that's nice of my girlfriend to say to me.
- Your girlfriend-- hi, you're supposed to kiss me And be like, "oh, I haven't seen you.
I haven't [bleep] seen you in, like, so long.
" You're not even kissing me-- [bleep] throwing up, [bleep] not doing anything to me.
So what the [bleep]? This is annoying.
A boyfriend's job is to come over, Have sex, and, you know, make your girlfriend feel good.
But at this point, Jionni's not making me feel good.
He's throwing up and passing out in my bed.
Like, you can do that at your own house.
You're just a sucky boyfriend tonight.
You suck.
Don't touch me, actually, 'cause I'm not feeling it.
- We're going to the dock.
- Yo, I'm gonna catch me Sunday dinner.
- Me and Nicole decide to take a boat out on the water.
All: Shark! - Shark? Shark? - So how is jionni? - Me and jionni's relationship is definitely not healthy, I mean, I'll tell you that.
- I don't want guys taking advantage of you.
- He's not.
- He better not.
- You alive? - All right.
Bye, loser.
I don't even like you.
- What can we do today with everybody? - I'm down for whatever.
We could do the boardwalk.
We could-- - is there anything else Differt that we can do? - We could go to a dock and fish.
- A what? - We can go to a dock and, like, crab.
- Do you want to do that? - Imagine if we caught fish.
- Meaning-- - If we went crabbing, we could cook the crabs later.
I mean, do you really need talent to fish, though? - I don't think so.
- You just throw the thing in the thing.
Imagine, though, eight guidos and-- - Trying to fish? - Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
We have to do that.
- Me and Sam thought of a great idea, guys.
We're going to the dock, And we're crabbing, fishing, everything! Are you guys ready to have some fun? - We're going to the dock.
- I already got crabs last night at karma.
- Pauly's excited.
- I know.
- I'm ready.
- Yo, I packed a cooler.
We're good.
You guys ready? - I'm ready.
- Let's go! - This is the dock.
- So we're just partying on the dock? - Yeah.
- I never thought I'd be excited about catching crabs.
But we're going to the dock today, And we're gonna catch some crabs and go fishing.
So, uh, what's the-- what's the deal out here? What--what do we do? Guidos don't crab, so - You guys are gonna take some of these lines right here.
- Okay.
- Drop lines.
- And I just launch it and wait? - Just wait, like, five minutes, and just bring it in.
- Do you put food in it? - Sure.
- What kind? - Maybe they want a show.
Break it in half.
- Ooh! - Wow, that's food right there.
- That's their food? - That's a real fish? - Yeah.
- Well, it's dead.
- You guys need anything else? - An extra bucket to throw up in.
- What about fishing? I think I'm gonna do that.
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, I wanna go fishing.
- Yeah.
- You don't have, like, cappuccino or espressos or-- - [laughs] - What kind of stuff do you have? - You don't have filet mignon, do you, With, uh, garlic mashed potatoes? - Where do you think you are? We're at a dock.
- Yo, I'm gonna catch me Sunday dinner.
- You know, we're not going food shopping, So we gotta catch our dinner tonight with our bare hands.
- Here, fishies, fishies, fishies, fishies.
- Did you know there's a fish called "snook"? - Ooh! - Oh, my God.
- Ron, you're caught.
- I caught a guido! - We caught a gorilla! - This is insane.
[all cheering] - Nice.
- Oh, stay! - Yo, why can't I just put snooki on this hook To catch me a big fish? - Oh, my God, I got three crabs! [screams] - crabs are here.
- Oh, my God.
Get real.
- Oops.
- Oh, [bleep].
Come here.
Oh! Oh! - Ooh, no! - I don't even want to say it.
- What? - I caught crabs.
[both laugh] - Are you-- - oh, I thought I got something.
- What did you catch? - Nothing.
- Yo, this ain't happening.
Guidos ain't made to fish.
I can fish for girls but not [bleep] for fish.
I'm realizing that I'm not the best crabber.
I'm not the best fisherman.
But I am still a guido, and I need to tan, So I'm just gonna sunbathe on the dock right now.
- What is he doing? - I don't know.
What the hell? - So Mike's just, like, spread-eagle right now In one of his feminine poses, And he's asking for some trouble right now.
- Oh, [bleep]! - [laughs] - Not cool, bro.
Not cool.
- I don't think there's any fish over here.
I feel like this is like my relationships-- Not one person wants to grab my bait.
Do you want to go on the boat? - Yeah.
- All right.
So me and Nicole decide to take a boat out on the water, Because we're like, "this would be awesome.
We could row and fish at the same time.
" - Whoa! Don't want to do that.
You got it? - I need help.
- I'll help you.
- Really? - All right.
Whoa! Oh! I got you.
I got you.
- The meatballs decide to take out this boat.
- That's good.
- I got it.
- But it's so windy out, I don't know how they're gonna make it Through the waves or anything.
- We have to get out of here.
- You have to [bleep] paddle.
Yeah, there you go.
- One, two, three, row.
- They're going against each other right now.
They're doing, like, a circle.
- Row! - Whoo! [bleep], you almost took my finger off.
- I didn't do it.
It was the wind.
- You guys have to paddle in sync Not the opposite ways.
- It's so windy out right now, and the boat is, you know, Going all over the place.
And I feel like the current is carrying me and Nicole away.
[laughter] and I'm like, "oh, my God, "like, let's frickin' try And row ourselves to, like, a dock.
" - Row! Row! - Wow.
- Yo, watch your heads.
- [screaming] - watch your heads.
- The meatballs have no idea what they're doing right now, And so myself and Ron-- You know, we gotta be the responsible ones And pull the plug on this.
- You guys got it? - Yeah, we got it.
- We're good.
- Yo, you're making it worse, I feel.
- No.
- Are you trying to flip us? - No.
- Get off.
Stop it.
- Get off, Ronnie.
- No, no, we're not.
- Ronnie, stop.
Yes, you are.
- We're not, we're not.
- Stop it.
- Ronnie, stop.
Stop.
We're trying to have a good time here.
- Stop it! - No.
I want to see if I can row.
- Get off.
No, I'm not even wearing a bikini.
- So I let the air out of the boat.
Arms are flapping in the air.
There's meatball sauce flying everywhere.
- [shrieks] This boat is sinking, and I've seen Titanic.
And this is not going to end well.
- Oh, watch out.
- Yeah, those things are sharp.
- Yo, watch--deena.
- What's sharp? - Sharks? Sharks? - Sharks! - Sharks! - Sharks! Sharks! Sharks! - Sharks! Sharks! Sharks! - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Deena, deena, watch out.
Watch out, deena.
Deena.
- So we're all screaming, "it's sharp! It's sharp! Like, stop doing what you're doing," 'cause there are sharp objects where they are.
And d thinks we're saying, "there's a shark!" - No, deena, you can't jump on that.
Deena, deena, deena, you can't-- that's too sharp.
You can't jump on that.
- Deena, sharp, sharp.
Sharp.
- That's sharp.
- Shark? - That's sharp.
Sharp, sharp, sharp.
- Sharp.
- Sharp.
Stay away from that.
Stay on the boat.
The boat is the safest thing.
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell? - I'm soaked.
- You gotta stay on the boat.
Stay on the boat.
- Go get them, Steven.
- Snooki.
Save her.
- [laughs] - I'm stuck.
- Deena's literally trying to get out of three feet of water Because there's sharks in it, And Nicole is just worried about her alcoholic beverage Floating away.
It was legit, complete chaos.
- Yeah, there's snookis all through these waters.
[laughs] Yo, you know how you catch a snooki? Pickles.
[laughs] - My eyelash fell off.
- Your eyelash is floating in the pacific as we speak.
Luckily, sharks seem to not like meatballs.
But unfortunately, none of us were capable Of really catching any fish and crabs.
So we're getting Chinese food.
- Ugh, I need to shower.
- You have to shower? - Ugh, the car smells like that smush room.
[all chuckle] - Your stalker came in yesterday.
- I'm afraid of this girl, 'cause every time I turn around, She's there.
- Oh, my God.
- We're gonna be like, "where's pauly?" - [laughs] yeah.
- And I'm freaked out.
- Wait.
Hold on.
- I see flashlights coming at us, And I'm like, "oh, my God.
" it's the frickin' cops.
- Mike, let me use the bathroom really quick before you shower.
- All right.
Tell-- oh, wow, Ronnie, wow.
- [laughs] - wow.
- Already? - Yeah.
- He just-- - he's working hard in there.
Whoa.
- [gags] oh, my God, it is bad.
- His insides are coming out.
- Oh, yeah, I need a plunger for that.
- I was like, "for real? He clogs the toilet every summer.
We just have to have a plumber on speed dial for Ron.
- Oh, my God.
- Come on.
- Gotta go to work.
- Today the dream team is going to work.
It's me, pauly, and vinny, And we're going to kill it at work today.
I have a good feeling.
My nail broke.
- Any more n135 in the back? - Totally sold out.
- What do you want to put on this? - I have no idea.
- Who's getting the white license plate? Anyone? - [laughs] - Oh, your stalker came in yesterday.
- What did she say? - I was--I was actually scared to talk to her.
I'll be honest with you.
- [bleep] creepy.
I got this new stalker.
Her name's Vanessa.
- He always sees you around.
What's your name? - Vanessa.
- I'm afraid of this girl, 'cause every time I turn around, She's there.
[creepy music] - Oh, my God.
- She doesn't talk, but she stalks.
- She wants to be a stalker.
- And she'll work my entire shift at the t-shirt shop Just staring at me.
Follows me home And then follows me to whatever club we go to at night And does the same thing at the club.
And I'm freaked out because she stares right at me With this, like, death look that I can feel Burning a hole in my head.
And it's messing with my blowout.
- She had the camera, the bag.
- What's in the bag? One day it's just gonna be dripping blood.
- And we're gonna be like, "where's pauly?" - All right, what are you waiting for, guys? Dtf, mvp? - That's a double dtf-- the front and on the back.
- Someone must be really dtf.
- What does dtf stand for? - Oh, it stands for "down to fish.
" [laughter] [rock music] - Where's jenni? - I don't know where they're at.
I know we're going to karma tonight.
You got your boyfriend coming tonight? - No, he's not coming, actually.
I'm really sad about it.
- Why not? - 'cause he has to work, and he's coming out Saturday.
- So how is jionni? Your relationship and all that [bleep]-- Is it good? Everything cool? Everything's good? He's not being a [bleep] to you anymore? - He's perfect.
I want to marry that kid - That's a big statement.
- It is.
- So, when somebody says at the wedding, "does anybody object?" and I run in the room - I'll shoot you with a pistol in your [bleep] eyeball.
Okay.
- I might have to.
I might have to run in.
- You wouldn't do that.
- Maybe--if I don't think he's right for you, maybe I will.
- Why don't you think he's right for me? - I think he's a nice kid.
I just don't think he's established as a man yet.
You know what I mean? To take care of you and stuff.
- Me and jionni's relationship is definitely not healthy, I mean, I'll tell you that.
Me and jionni do [bleep]-up [bleep], But, you know, I don't like questioning our relationship.
- I'm just saying I'm definitely overprotective Of you, for sure.
- Why? - I care about you-- that's all.
That's for real.
We're friends.
I don't want guys [bleep] taking advantage of you.
- He's not.
- He better not.
- Get real! I kind of want to break a law or two tonight.
- Time's up.
- Are we in trouble? - See you later, bro.
- See you tomorrow morning.
Bye, Steve.
- Thanks a lot, guys.
Bye, guys.
- Let's play this game.
- What is this game? - I don't know-- you just throw it, I guess.
- Oh, don't play with the balls like that.
Come on, now.
- Shut up, you pervert.
- Oh! - Oh! - Whoo! - Oh, wow.
- Yeah, buddy.
I know how to work my balls.
- You sure do.
- Whoo! Let's do a bet.
- All right, how about this? Whoever loses-- they gotta wear the bunny suit Somewhere public, like-- - the whole bunny suit? - Like, the whole bunny suit.
- She's called "Lola.
" So Lola is the biggest Vegas prostitute With fake boobs, fake ass, fake vagina, And she's my bunny.
- What the hell is that? [screams, laughs] - Like, yo, you gotta wear the bunny suit to karma tonight, But only for, like, 15 minutes they gotta wear it.
- All right, cool.
- For 15 minutes.
- Starting now? - I guess so.
Ah, yes.
- Oh, [bleep].
Get real.
- Ah, yes, yes! - Oh, come on.
- Oh, come on.
- I don't care.
You can do distractions.
- All I gotta do is make one.
All I gotta do is make one.
Oh! All I gotta do is make one.
- No.
- Yeah.
- This is, like, a five thing.
- Oh, I won! - No, you-- - You gotta wear the bunny suit to karma.
- No, we didn't say one.
We didn't say one.
- Yeah, you did-- whoever makes the most.
- No, I meant, like, a whole game.
- Whoever won this little bet we did, You had to wear the bunny suit in public for ten minutes.
- Oh, that's awesome.
- Even though I lost the bet and I had to wear Lola to karma, I mean, it's not really a big deal Because Lola is, like, my best friend.
So I'm kind of, like, hanging out With my best friend right now, And we're going to karma together.
- Are they gonna let her in with the bunny suit? - You don't tell Lola where she gets to go.
- That actually looks pretty hot.
I might want to reconsider having sex with you now.
You should just always leave the mask on.
Stripper, prostitute, bunny Lola Is pretty hot tonight, I think.
If I was a bunny and I wanted to bang bunnies, I'd bang Lola.
- Cabs are here.
- Cab's here, cab's here.
- [speaking italian] - Cabs are here.
- So weird.
- Hi! [vinny chuckles] [lively music] - All right, game on.
Let's go straight to the bar.
I might just jump on the dance floor.
[overlapping chatter] Oh, my God, Lola's at karma.
[dance music] - All right, gotta go from, uh, here to--to there.
- Come on, ten minutes.
- You got ten minutes.
Snooki lost a bet.
She is, you know, taking it on the chin, And it's gonna be awesome.
- I love guidos! - Honestly, I'm gonna be dying in the suit.
It's gonna smell like alcohol, sweat, and [bleep].
- Lola is definitely the most popular girl at karma tonight.
I'm a little jealous.
I'm about to bring her home for myself.
- Nicole's dancing.
She's, like, rabbit-humping people.
And on top of it, everyone's putting the bunny suit on And having a blast with it.
It's just not a normal night at karma.
It's a Lola night at karma.
- [screams] - Show your abs! - What? - Show your abs again.
[bleep] hot.
Can I touch them? Whoo! - I'm a dtf girl.
- What's your name? - Stephanie.
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm all down for it.
- All right, sounds cool to me.
- [laughs] - I actually am like the hunter and gatherer of the house When it comes to ladies.
This is pauly, and this is vinny.
I hunt them, and I gather them, And I hand them out to the boys in the crib.
Her and her girl are dtf, for sure.
- Oh, word.
- For sure, right here.
- So Mike finds this girl.
He's like, "listen, this girl is dtf.
She'll even tell you.
And here's both of her friends.
" I'm like, "okay.
I guess you got that out of the way.
" - All right, let's get a cab.
I got Lola for you.
- Let's go to the beach.
- Wait.
Hold on.
Me and Nicole are leaving karma, and we still have, like, A lot of energy in us, and we just-- We're not ready to go home yet.
- Come on, girls.
- [giggles] - What's up? - Mvp is in full effect.
Tonight we're bringing back three girls.
- Life's like a box of chocolates.
Both: You never know what you're gonna get.
- This is the place right here.
We are here.
- Come on, I want to go in the [bleep] ocean Like I used to.
This is awesome.
- What's with this [bleep] gate? Should we hop it? - That's what I used to do.
- [grunts] yeah, right.
All right.
[laughs] - I kind of want to, you know, like, Break a law or two tonight, so hopping the fence is one.
Let me just touch the ocean.
Let me just touch the ocean.
Being on the beach when you're not supposed to Is another, so I feel like a legit criminal.
And it's kind of, like, thrilling.
Get real! - Huh, huh, huh.
So we're running down the beach, Frickin' wind in our face, hair blowing, Boobs bouncing up and down.
So the only difference between the meatballs And Baywatch right now is the red bathing suits And David Hasselhoff.
[chuckles] So me and my meatball are in the ocean.
I see flashlights coming at us, And I'm like, "oh, my God.
" It's the frickin' cops.
- I do not want to get arrested for this.
- Nicole, time's up.
- That's a minibike.
To Nicole, that's, like, a normal-size motorcycle.
- [screams] oh, my God.
- Use the brake! - [screams] - Get real! - Huh, huh, huh, huh.
- Time's up.
- [laughs] - Come on.
- Ew, ew.
Me and my meatball are in the ocean.
I see these lights coming at us.
- You're not really supposed to be on the beach right now.
- The cops tell us we have to be removed from the beach Or we're getting arrested.
- What did we do? - You're on the beach after dark--come on.
- Could u hold my hand? - I'm not going to hold your hand.
- So I think this frickin' cop's cute, And I'm like, "you know what? I always love a man in uniform.
" I bet in real life, you're, like, a really good time.
You'd probably be doing the same stuff we do.
- Deena, shut up.
- Might as well just try and bring home a cop.
Where are you from? - From around here.
- Maybe he can use s handcuffs later.
- Bye.
Love you.
- That definitely was some hot sex.
You know, me and my girl were done with our-- Our-- our situation.
And I actually helped the other boys Get their girls out of the house very nice and smooth.
The taxi will be here in five minutes.
- Mike comes in the room.
And he's like, "listen, the cabs are here, If you want your girl to leave with my girl.
" So the cabs are here.
See you.
- Have a nice ride.
Bye, sweetie.
The night ended, and everybody's happy.
Girls out the crib, boys get to sleep alone And have a nice sleep.
- Let's go to bed.
- Lights off.
- Holy, butt sack, I'm tired.
Go make me an orange juice and vodka.
No, I'm not kidding.
- Sleeping in? You're gonna throw up? All right.
- [burping] [sighs] Oh, my God, I almost threw up.
- I feel like walking dirt.
- Dude, I have [bleep] sand in my [bleep].
This morning I feel like freakin' ass.
Like, I'm still drunk, but it's, you know, The drunk where you want to throw up, And you feel disgusting.
I'd rather just drink it off.
- What can we do today? - Let's go to the bar.
- I'm still drunk.
- Let's drink more! Ronnie looks like [bleep] right now, And I'm like, "bro, like, you're hungover.
We need to go to the bar and fix that.
" So you want to go to the bar? Sam, let's go.
- I can't.
- I'm going to get my nail fixed.
- Ron, you're the savior right now.
I don't want to go to the [bleep] nail salon.
I want to go to the bar.
- Let's go.
- Let's go! Do you have a cigarette? - I don't have any.
- Do any of you guys have a lighter? - They're, like, 12.
- Oh.
[both laugh] - Ugh.
- Snooki! - Oh, don't throw up, please.
Oh, here we are.
To Lola.
Yum.
All right, you drink.
You get hung--un-hungover.
And I'll be back in two seconds.
- Where you going? You're leaving me.
- I just need to go get something real quick.
So Ronnie saw this bike, like, a couple days on the boardwalk, And he was like, "oh, my God.
I really want it.
" I'm looking for a frickin' motorcycle.
So I love Ron to death.
He's like my big brother.
I mean, dude, I'm gonna buy Ron the frickin' minibike.
Oh! Yo, I'm buying this off you.
You know, I just like Ron to be happy.
- [laughs] I look over.
I'm just seeing snooki's head floating.
I'm like, "what is this girl doing?" - [laughs] here's your motorcycle.
- [laughs] how are you? - It needs gas.
- You got me the bike? - Yeah.
- Oh, [bleep].
I'm blown away, because I never thought That snooki was actually that nice.
Thank you, snook.
- Of course, Ron.
Can I ride it and you push me? So the bike does have gas in it, but we can't ride it, Because if we do ride it on the boardwalk, We've had a couple drinks, And we'll probably get a dui and go to jail.
[pop music] So Ron is just pushing me the whole way Down the boardwalk with the bike, And you know what? I feel cool.
See, I'm on the line.
You're gonna [bleep] pull me over.
[both laughing] - Oh, yeah.
- You're pulling in front of me.
Don't do that.
- Oh, sorry.
Sorry, gramps.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
- Cool.
Excuse me, gramps.
- To average people, that's a minibike.
To Nicole, that's, like, a normal-size motorcycle for her.
It's [bleep] amazing.
You got it? Holy [bleep].
- [screams] And then I look back, and Ron's not holding me anymore.
And I'm legit, like, going - Brakes! Start to brake! - And I'm like, "cool, I'm gonna die.
" I can't stop.
[giggles] - She's so creepy.
- Which one? - Pauly's stalker.
I'm fed up.
I want to approach her, and I want to ask What the hell her deal is.
Vanessa, come here.
- Come on.
- I'm walking on the boardwalk with Nicole, And I'm not gonna lie.
- Can we cuddle tonight? - Yep.
This is kind of questionable, what I'm doing.
- Cool.
For summer, we blow something up.
- I remember when we almost blew up the grill The first summer we were here.
- Take care of it before we blow the [bleep] up.
- I thought we were dead in Italy.
- Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! - Ron, be careful.
- The whole gas thing freaks me out.
[all yelling] - We got problems with fire.
- Yeah, we're not good.
- Excuse me.
Hello [all yelling] - You said "excuse me.
Hello!" - Fire, that's what you say.
[bleep] fire! - Time to go to work.
- Mike, time to go to work.
Mike, time to go to work.
- You know what time we go to work.
- Shore store employee.
- I work there.
I'm a new employee.
- You work there? - Yeah.
- Oh, that's a good thing.
[chuckles] - Oy vey.

How can I help you? This is what it says on my Booty shorts.
- Oh, that's cute.
- Who's next? - Yes, the fish on top of the white rice, yes.
And then I want a, uh, chicken Caesar wrap.
- Who's next? So I got the night shift tonight.
It's me, situation, and jenni.
- I want two pieces of salmon.
- So I expect to be doing most of the working.
- I just got mad food.
- Two times.
One, two.
[creepy music] - Oh, my God, she's so [bleep] creepy.
- Which one? - Pauly's stalker.
I just see her eye-beaming us.
You see her? - [chuckles] - Oh, my God.
Just look at her just, like, staring straight ahead Behind someone-- you see her? Pauly, your girl is creeping me out right now.
- Me too.
So I'm stuck at the t-shirt shop slaving away.
And I look up, and my stalker's there--Vanessa.
This girl is going to kill me.
She's gonna kidnap me, Put me in her basement, have me dj for her, And I'm gonna be m.
I.
A.
You guys are gonna be looking for me.
- Pauly's stalker officially scares me.
- She's got that bag all the time.
- Oh, yeah, I'm about to-- I'm probably gonna ask today.
- You gotta.
- Today's my day.
At this point, I am just so fed up With seeing this girl creeping me out.
I want to approach her, And I want to ask what the hell her deal is.
Vanessa, come here.
We all gotta know What's the deal? - Yo, why do you gotta mess with my stalker right now? - What's in the bag? - Nothing.
- Nothing in the bag? - Blanket.
- Just a blanket? - Yeah.
- Vanessa's trying to say that there's a blanket In the bag, but she doesn't pull it out for me.
I think the blanket is wrapped around something heavy.
It's either pauly's hair or a chain saw.
- I know what's in the bag now-- a blanket.
Maybe that's the blanket she was gonna kill me in.
Yo, it's not dj pauly d anymore.
It's gonna be dj pauly dead.
- Am I making you awkward right now? Little bit, huh? - Have I been making it awkward? - Yo, honestly, you'll be like this.
Got a boyfriend? - Yeah.

" I'm frickin' horny, and that's all I have to say.

I was killing it in pool yesterday.

- Exactly.
- There will be all single girls all over the place, And then we just go out, have a good time.
Yeah, buddy.
Yo, you hear what jenni's doing tonight? - What? - It's her and Roger's anniversary.
So they're she decorated the smush room As, like, all decorated for their anniversary.

It's like couples' retreat.
I feel like I need to be in a relationship in the house.
You know? - That's why we're in a relationship.

And we gotta make it happen tonight, man, you know? - Let's do it.
- I've been trying to plan this master plan For a number of weeks now.
And time is running out.
The summer is almost over.
It's got to go down.
She tried to play me like a chess piece recently, So the girl's gotta get her medicine, She's gotta get her medicine, that's it.
I don't lie about things.
I'm definitely not leaving this house Without showing people that I'm not a liar.
All right, brother, peace.
- Oh, there we go.
- How the are we gonna carry all this? - We got back to the house, mission accomplished.
I'm gonna shower, then decorate the smush room With rose petals and bondage equipment.
- Oh, my God.
- Just saying.
I'm really excited for my date with Roger tonight.
It's a little different, But I'm just trying to keep it fun, Because me and Roger aren't very romantic.
I'm so gross, I can't wait to shower.
- Later, my man.
- Later, man.
- Take care, thank you.
- Ice cream! What's our next order of business? Do you wanna retake, reclaim the smush room? The smush room is supposed to be for single people, Not for everybody to bring in their boyfriends every night.
So we found out a solution.
- If we take the bed out, The couples will stop using the smush room.
- Mm-hmm.
This is the best day of my life.
- Single gang or die.
- Yeah, buddy.
- Me and pauly do a little fix to the smush room.
It's not much, but it's some kinda message To the people.
And we take the bed, and we put it outside So that the smush room can't be used anymore For a couple's retreat.
Ugh, I just got pregnant.
Ugh! Dude, I just got some of Mike's baby on my chin.
- How is that different from any other night? Let's disguise it.
All right.
Busted.
- Jenni's gonna be pissed Because she has this whole anniversary thing planned, And the smush room bed is outside.
Like, what is she gonna do now? - Oh, , we got busted.
- Big time.
- You didn't see anything.
You say one word to anyone, I'll kill you.
- Busted big time, yes.
Your sister was nice enough to give you her whole outfit? Is that a jirt? - It is a jirt.
- I loved you in the Dukes of Hazzard.
- Oh, the smush room? - What the happened to the smush bed? - I know.
Watch yourself.
- Let's disguise it.
- All right.
- busted.
- Oh, , we got busted.
- Big time.
- You didn't see anything.
You say one word to anyone, I'll kill you.
- That sucks.
- Sucks.
Leave it to Sammi to be.
Think they can't see it now? - Mm-hmm, now they can't definitely see it.
'cause I can barely see it.
Wait, where did we put it? - I don't know.
- You got busted big time.
What's next on our list of bringing our shore house back? is about to hit the fan.
Let's go to sleep.
- Wait.
What the happened to the smush bed? - I know.
Watch yourself.
- Where is it? Who put it there? - I'll give you two guesses.
- I don't know who to blame right now, But the only thing I can think of, Whoever did this is gonna get it back tenfold.
Who moved the smush bed? - Got my back, bro? - Mm-hmm.
- Did you guys relocate the smush bed? look at his face.
You're such an ass.
That was a good prank though.
I've tried to set up a "romantic" night for Roger, And these ass are everything up.
I have to think of something really good To get them back.
- How you gonna get that yourself? - Supposedly it's light.
Pfft.
Ew, it's so dirty.
I didn't think it would be this hard to have sex.
After I get the bed back in, I am gonna decorate it Jersey style With rose petals and bondage equipment.
That's my romance.
Toys.
There we go.
How romantic.
So romantic.
Rose petals and handcuffs, d.
- Oh, my God.
Is he gonna flip? - He's gonna die, and his presents are out there.
- Holy.
- Ew! glass.
Ew! Our plan to reclaim the smush room Didn't amount to anything Because we're outnumbered by couples.
Eventually the couples are gonna win.
So jenni brings the bed back in And turns it into a old person smush room.
- Oh, my goodness.
