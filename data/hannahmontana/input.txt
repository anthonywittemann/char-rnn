(SINGING) This is the life, hold on tight And this is the dream Fourteen-year-old sensation Hannah Montana continues her smash tour with another sold-out show tomorrow night in Los Angeles.
I'm gonna take my time, yeah I'm still getting it right BOTH: (SINGING) This is the life (WHOOPING) Did you hear that? Sold out in Los Angeles.
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN) Needle in finger.
Sharp shooting pain.
- I'm sorry, Fermine.
- Is okay.
I kiss it.
All better.
All right.
Look at you, you look gorgeous.
You're gonna look beautiful in your finale.
Do it with me, come on now.
Work it out, work it out and pop it.
(FABRIC TEARING) Oh! Tushy tear.
Awkward moment, time to go.
- Don't look at my booty! - No danger there, partner.
I love you Hannah Montana.
Do you mind? I'm on the phone here, all right? I've got a life too, you know.
And I would appreciate it if I could have one conversation without hearing the words Hannah Montana.
Yeah, that's right, girl, I know Hannah Montana.
And I got two incredible tickets for tomorrow night.
Great.
See you then.
I need two incredible seats for tomorrow night.
- Sorry, I'm sold out.
- Dad! Think about it this way, Miley.
He goes out with the girl, they fall in love, they get married, he moves out.
You've got the tickets.
(PHONE RINGING) Hello? LILLY: Hey, it's me, landing in 20 seconds! Great! - Lilly alert in 18 seconds! - She's your best friend, Miley.
Sooner or later you're gonna have to tell her you're Hannah Montana.
- I pick later! - Nine seconds.
Get the juice! - Got it.
- Good.
- Three - Two - One.
- Guess who just landed two tickets to the hottest concert in town? Miley, you and I, I being your best friend, are going to see the one, the only, Hannah Montana! (WHOOPING) You're not screaming.
Why aren't you screaming? Oh, believe me, she's screaming on the inside.
(SCREAMING) (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) I just don't get it.
Why won't you go to the concert with me? It's just that I really want to spend some quality time with my brother.
Quality time with your brother? Okay, if you don't want to tell me, I guess there's nothing I can do, except go through life wondering what I did to deserve being hurt so badly - by my best friend.
- Oh, stop.
I just can't go, okay? Okay.
That's fine.
Hey, Miley.
How's it going? Pretty good.
Just getting some ketchup for my veggie burger.
I see you like mayonnaise.
I've never tried that on a veggie burger and maybe I should but not today, - because I've already got the ketchup - Miley.
Miley.
You know what a lot of people don't know is, it's also a wonderful moisturizer.
Here.
- Isn't that lovely? - Moisturizer.
You're pretty funny.
My hand does feel softer.
- Wow.
- I know.
He is so hot.
And I am so lame.
Hey! He's the one who believed ketchup was a moisturizer.
Miley, you've been totally crushing on Johnny Collins for months.
He thought you were funny.
This is your chance.
He's sitting right there.
Let's move! - I just can't do it.
- Yes, you can.
Miley, you're smart, you're funny, and you're totally cute.
And now you have my lucky bracelet.
- Okay.
- Wait.
Booger check.
- You're so gross.
- All clear.
Good to go.
Seriously, dude, it really does soften your skin.
Hi, Johnny.
Hey, Amber, Ashley.
- We were going to sit there.
- Well, isn't that just too bad? But don't worry.
There are seats over there by the trash cans.
At the losers' table.
Ooh! (MIMICKING SIZZLE) Hey, Amber, I think it might be time to pluck the 'stache.
And, Ashley, is that a zit, or are you growing a new head? - Gross! - Gross! Ooh! (MIMICKING SIZZLE) Okay, we didn't get those seats.
Minor setback.
But the good news is we have better seats for Hannah Montana! I'm sorry.
It's just that I don't like Hannah Montana.
What? Hey, baby.
How you doing? Oliver Oken, and may I say you two are smoking? - In your dreams.
- I'm counting on that.
Hey, slick.
Hey.
Oh, yeah.
She wants me.
Oliver, you're not going to believe this.
Miley says she doesn't like Hannah Montana.
What? Hannah Montana is a goddess.
I worship at her feet.
In fact, FYI, someday I'm going to be Mr.
Hannah Montana.
I'm gonna watch her every minute of every day, protect her from any obsessed fans.
Every night I'll shampoo and condition that beautiful blonde hair.
Oliver, I say this because I care about you.
Get some help! Miley, don't make me go see my favorite singer without my best friend.
If you don't take this ticket, I'm going to end up going to the concert with Mr.
Hannah Montana.
(LOUDLY) You have an extra ticket to Hannah Montana? (ALL GASP) That was really loud, wasn't it? Hey, Dad.
I'm really nervous about my date, and, well, I'm just gonna say this, there is nobody in the world whose advice I trust and respect more than you.
- Son, I'm not loaning you money.
- What? Is that what you think this is about? Dad, I am hurt.
This has nothing to do with borrowing money from you.
I was actually kind of hoping more for an outright gift.
I gave you the gift of life, Son.
Don't push it.
- Honey, what happened? - Hannah Montana happened.
You mean the kids at school found out? No, this was just about a ticket to see Hannah Montana.
What if they found out I was Hannah Montana? - No one would treat me the same.
- I bet Lilly would.
Are you kidding? She's Hannah's biggest fan.
If she knew the truth, I'd never be just Miley again.
- Oh, baby doll.
- I'm taking a walk on the beach.
Now hold on just a minute.
First, let's get this French fry out of your hair before the seagulls attack you.
Boy, that sucker is in there, too.
Second of all, I know you're concerned that if Lilly finds out the truth that she won't treat you the same.
But she's still your best bud.
You need to trust that.
- At least think about telling her.
- Okay.
Not gonna happen.
Dad, I only hope that when I'm a father I can give my - No money.
- Didn't think so.
(SINGING) This is the life, hold on tight And this is the dream, it's all I need You'll never know where you'll find it and I'm gonna take my time, yeah I'm still getting it right, this is the life MILEY: Thank you, Los Angeles.
- "Hannah Montana.
" There you go.
- Thank you.
Hey, just another fan.
Could you sign this to Johnny? It's not me.
It's my little brother.
He really likes you.
Not that I don't, I do, but, you know, he wanted me to get it, so I'm getting it.
Yeah, so if you could just sign that to Johnny, my little brother.
- There you go.
Hey, really soft hands.
- Thanks, it's ketchup.
Bye.
Thanks, guys.
Be sure and pick up a record and a t-shirt in the lobby.
He is so cute.
Honey, at your age, there's only two things that are cute, squirrels and little puppy dogs.
(EXCLAIMS) I tell you what, I hate wearing this thing.
It's like kissing your Great-Aunt Clara.
Great show tonight.
I'll go check on the limo.
Your mama would have been so proud of you.
Thanks, Dad.
- Higher, Oliver.
I'm almost in.
- There is no higher.
You're already standing on my head! Jump, you idiot, jump! (OLIVER GRUNTS) (SCREAMS) Not good! Oops! And she sticks the landing! Hannah Montana's hot dogs! Hannah Montana's scarf! Hannah Montana! (BOTH SCREAMING) Whoever you are, you have to get out of here right now or I'll call security! Wait, wait! No, I'm sorry.
I was just looking for a souvenir.
My name's Lilly Truscott, and I'm a huge fan.
Did you just shove pie in your face? It's not a real pie.
It's a foaming facial-wash pie.
- What's wrong with your voice? - That happens after every concert.
You give so much! - I just wish Miley were here.
- Miley? Who's Miley? I don't know Miley.
That's a strange name.
She's my best friend.
Great.
Well, then, why don't you go get her? Great idea! I'll call her! No! You know, cell phones don't really work in here.
It has to do with the walls and the cement and (CELL PHONE RINGING) Okay.
They must have fixed it.
Aren't you gonna get that? No, I'm talking to you.
That would be rude.
- Okay, she's not home.
- Wow, that was weird.
Why don't I just give you an autograph for her? What about me? I'm the one who loves you! You're much paler in person.
Yeah, I am, you know what? Gosh, it was really fun meeting you guys, - but I've really got to go.
- Wait! Can't I even shampoo and condition your beautiful blonde hair? No, but you can take this towel.
Hannah Montana's towel.
(SCREAMING) It's okay.
None of my blood got on the towel! - Well, I guess I'm leaving, too.
- Okay.
- Without even a towel as a souvenir.
- Bye-bye.
Nothing but my memories, which will fade too, too quickly.
All right, all right.
Here.
Oh, my gosh! The actual scarf you wore on the actual stage.
I can't believe it.
This is so Hey, I have a lucky bracelet just like that.
I loaned it to my best friend yesterday.
Of course mine says "Lilly" on the back Just like that.
Ta-da! Lilly, I know you're upset I didn't tell you, but you cannot just freeze me out like this.
Please talk to me.
I thought we were friends.
I thought we told each other everything! But I guess I was wrong, since you kept just about the biggest secret in the world, Miley StewartlHannah Montana! Okay, well, other than that, did you enjoy the concert? That's right, I happen to be real tight with Hannah Montana.
Hey, Hannah.
I thought my lady here could use a little souvenir.
Jackson, get out of here! For you.
I told you we were tight.
I am so out of here.
Lilly, please wait.
I wanted to tell you.
It's just that I was afraid.
Afraid of what? I don't know.
I thought maybe once you knew, you wouldn't want to be my friend anymore, and you'd like Hannah Montana more than you like me.
That's what you thought? That could never happen, Miley.
Don't you know that? Yeah, I do.
Okay, no more secrets.
And to prove it, I'm going to show you something I've never shown to any other friend.
Wait till you see this! Why am I standing in your closet? Because behind my closet is My closet! (HALLELU JAH PLAYING) It's like a dream, a beautiful, beautiful dream.
Okay, dream's over.
I've got to have these.
- Wait, there's more.
- Another closet? - What size shoe do you wear? - I'm a 5.
I'm a 6, but I'll squeeze! - Wait till Amber and Ashley find out.
- What? Well, we have to tell them.
Here's my cell.
Take a picture of me in front of Hannah Montana's clothes! No! No one else can see this stuff.
- Are you crazy? Why not? - Once people know I'm Hannah, - they won't treat me the same.
- That's the point! I'm talking mega-popularity here for both of us.
Think about Johnny Collins.
He'd be yours if he knew.
- No! - How can you be so selfish? If you were really my best friend, you'd want this for me! And if you were my best friend, you'd understand why I can't do it! - Come on, cut me some slack, Hannah.
- "Hannah"? I knew this would happen.
Did I say Hannah? I didn't mean that.
It was a mistake.
No, the mistake was trusting you.
That girl tonight really dug me, Dad.
I think it was the guns.
Hey, Lilly.
I think things are gonna be a whole lot better around here now that you know our little secret.
Did you see the way she ignored you? I'm sorry, but that is no way to treat a man of your compassion, sensitivity Still no money? I am so mad.
So you're gonna take it out on my ice-cream sundae? - You wanna talk about it? - No.
Okay.
(SINGING) You had a fight She left your place And now you sit and stuff your face You got the processed-sugar blues Stop! That's the worst song you've ever written.
She obviously doesn't remember the potty-training song.
(SINGING) I like to sing, I like to dance but I can't do it with poopy in my pants Dad! This is so not funny.
Everything I was afraid that would happen happened.
She found out who I was, and now it's ruined everything.
You don't know that for sure, Mile.
Things could change.
Just give it some time.
Group hug! - Gotta go.
- Gotta go.
Turn.
I don't know, I think it makes me look a little big around the hips.
Please, let's not blame the dress.
- Hey, guys, sorry we're - Whoa, doggies! Daddy, he's finally cracked.
You know what, Son? I like it, but I don't think it goes with the shoes.
Okay, fine, you take your little cracks.
But you weren't here, and Fermine needed help with the dress, and he said he'd pay me, so this is what you get.
Next time, try something with sleeves and deodorant.
If you got it, flaunt it.
Which reminds me, I've got a little blue sequined number waiting for me.
Enjoy! Okay, Fermine, how much do I owe you? Kid works cheap.
He did it for $20.
Daddy! You made him do that? Hey, the boy said he needed some money.
I thought I might as well get a chuckle out of it.
Lilly alert.
Hey, Fermine, why don't we step out on the patio and give these girls some privacy? Okay, but I'm going to need some sunscreen.
- My skin's like a baby's bottom.
- A little too much information, cowboy.
Oh, look at me! Giddy up, pardner.
Yippee kiyay! Giddy up.
Yippee kiyay.
Hey, can I talk to you? Who? Miley or Hannah? - Miley.
- She's not talking to you right now.
Wait, Miley, I'm sorry I called you Hannah, but that was major news.
You gotta give me a little time to get used to it.
What happens if you can't? What about the next time you get dissed by Amber and Ashley? Are you sure you won't want to tell them? Of course I'll want to, but I won't.
And you know why? Because you're my best friend.
When I was sitting in my room, all upset, you're the one I wanted to talk to, not Hannah Montana.
Well, I guess I've said everything.
So, see ya.
Here I go, headed for the door, after making the best apology I could possibly think of.
Still hoping she forgives me.
Halfway there.
You are such a drama queen.
- Hugs? - Hugs? I am so not getting paid enough for this.
Neither am I.
We were in the first row, and Hannah smiled right at us.
- She really did.
- Big deal.
You see this towel? She gave it to me in her dressing room.
She really did.
Yeah, and she gave me this sandwich.
- You're pathetic.
- You're pathetic.
Ooh! (MIMICKING SIZZLE) - It's true.
- Ignore them, Oliver.
- They're not worth it.
- Wait a minute.
He's telling the truth.
And she gave Lilly something, too.
- What are you doing? - You'll see.
- That's Hannah Montana's scarf.
- From the concert.
Yeah.
Hannah gave it to her.
But you know what? You guys are much cooler than me.
- You should have it.
- Oh, my gosh.
Hey, I want that! - Why'd you do that? - I think I know.
Hey, everybody! It's Hannah Montana's scarf! (SCREAMING) Ooh! (MIMICKING SIZZLE) 

(SINGING) Yeah! Yeah! So what you see is only half the story There's another side of me I'm a girl you know but I'm someone else, too If you only knew! It's a crazy life But I'm all right I got everything I've always wanted I'm living the dream So, yeah everything I've always wanted Isn't always what it seems I'm a lucky girl Whose dreams came true But underneath it all, I'm just like you Isn't always what it seems I'm a lucky girl whose dreams came true But underneath it all, I'm just like you Clear the way, people, superstar coming through! Superstar coming through! And her jet-set friend, Miss Lola Lafonda.
Lola Lafonda? If people figure out I'm Lilly, it's only a short jump to Miley.
Oh, very smart, Miss Lola.
Thank you, everybody! I love you all! - Thank you! - This is totally insane! Back off, people! Back off.
Don't make me release Thor! (LILLY GROWLING) Yeah, you go get them, Thor.
Two pounds of pure piddle just looking for a target.
Actually, I think he just found Oh, man! - Hannah! Hold up! Wait! - Oh, no.
It's Oliver again.
He snuck into my dressing room last week.
Nearly jumped on stage the week before.
And just when you think he can't get any more obsessed, bam, he kicked it up a notch! Look at those bony little elbows go! That boy cuts through the crowd like a weed whacker.
Hannah! Let me through! Hannah, please! Kiss my hand and I'll never wash it again.
Looks like he never washes it now.
Come on, Thor, make yourself useful.
Baby, you're an animal! Oh, I like them feisty.
- Let's rock and roll, driver! - Man, he's never gonna give up.
- Well, you better hope he does.
Because if he ever finds out your secret, he's not only gonna be in love with Hannah Montana, he'll be in love with you! (CHUCKLING) What? That's crazy! The only thing that's the same about Hannah Montana and me is Me.
And me doesn't feel that way about him.
Well, don't worry, Mile.
I know guys, and sooner or later he's gonna get tired of chasing after somebody who's not chasing him back.
(LILLY GASPING) (PANTING) Do a dude a favor and don't get on the freeway! For you, my love! Why did you have to be such a good kisser? (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) It's all true.
Hannah actually kissed this hand.
- You gotta be kidding me.
- A big slobbery wet one.
Look, it's still shiny.
Yeah, there's nothing like the romantic glow of dog drool.
Chad, dude, close up shop when you chew.
You're getting spit on the Hannah hand! Miley, let's go.
You're cutting into my tan time.
Look at him, he's never gonna quit.
What happens if he does find out? I really do care about Oliver.
And I just don't wanna weird out our friendship.
Unless deep down, maybe, just maybe, you feel the same way.
Yes, and maybe, just maybe that's insane! And now that she's left her mark on me, it's time to take our relationship to the next step.
Tonight at her CD signing, I'm gonna stare into her eyes and say, "You are my love, my life, and someday you'll be my " Note to self.
Think of words that rhyme with "Life.
" Dude, isn't that the Hannah hand? The CD signing! If he stares into my eyes, he might recognize me.
- It's never gonna happen.
- But what if it does? Maybe you could learn to love him like I did with my brother's hamster.
And here's the beauty part, if Oliver dies, you won't have to bury him in the backyard.
When you talk, do you hear it, or is there like a big roaring in your ears? - Step off, Chad! - Fine.
But you're gonna throw this away for me.
Take it off, dude! Take it off! Take it off! Take it off! Dude, what's with you and the gum chewing? Oh, little baby Ollie.
Aunt Harriet just wants to eat you up.
You're so yummy, yummy, yummy.
(BABY CRYING) Oh Let me get that off you.
(GRUNTING) I hate that woman.
(SINGING) Been sitting here all morning trying to write a song Can't remember when it ever took me this dang long Maybe I should just up and fly the coop 'Cause everything I've written sounds like I got it, Dad! I got it! Prepare to be blown away.
This better be good, Son.
I was in the middle of a masterpiece.
Jackson Stewart, come on down! You are the proud owner of a brand-new used car! Yes, over the last 15 years this pre-owned beauty's been driven around by heavy smokers and sloppy eaters and one Wilma McDermott, whose cat popped out six kittens on the front seat.
Yes, some stains just don't come out! - And you're happy about that? - Yes, I am! Dad, it's mine.
It's not perfect, but it's my own car, and I bought it with my own money.
I'm proud of ya, Son.
Especially the "bought it with your own money" part.
Let's go take a look at this puppy.
Puppies, that reminds me, and in the backseat I don't wanna know.
(IMITATES TRUMPET) Voil�.
Yep, there she is.
Clean, no dents and there's that stain.
- Where is it? - It's right here.
- This? - I know.
I can't believe it's mine, either.
And I can't believe you just bought a girl car.
What? Jackson, only girls drive this thing.
It's a chick mobile, a babe bucket, a skirt scooter.
You might as well have bought a bra with tires, man.
You are so wrong.
This is totally a guys' car.
When I was driving home there was guys honking and waving and giving me kissy faces.
Oh, no.
Dad, tell me I didn't just buy a chick car.
You didn't buy a chick car.
Now say it like you mean it.
I'd like to, Son, but You know how ladies like to have the final word.
(HONKING HORN) Thank you so much! I love you all! Thank you! Thank you! Let's boogie, driver! That was great! Oliver stared right into my eyes and never had a clue.
Kind of like the look he has in Spanish.
"No comprendo!" I don't know what I was so worried about anyway.
Yeah.
(SCREAMING) Better pull over, driver! Don't be scared! It's me, Oliver Oken! Wow, you're even more beautiful upside down.
- Thank you.
You're so sweet.
- He was talking to me.
Look, you are very sweet, but I have a boyfriend.
A boyfriend? Wait, I don't understand.
- Then why'd you kiss me? - I didn't.
The dog did.
Oh, man.
Those are the lips I've been thinking about for the past 24 hours? I'm sorry.
I was trying not to hurt your feelings, it's just that I'm just not interested.
- Okay? - Okay.
I get it.
Now get down off the roof, son, before you dent it.
- This is a rental.
- Fine.
I won't bother you anymore.
If it helps, the dog hasn't stopped talking about you.
God.
You must think I'm pathetic.
No, I think you're sweet.
And maybe if I didn't have a boyfriend then - I'd have a chance with you? - I never said that.
But you implied it! And that's good enough! I'll wait for you forever! - But I never said that! - Forever! Do you hear me, Hannah Montana? Forever! That was close.
He almost caught you tonight! Ya think? You know what that boy needs? A real girlfriend.
Dad, that is the smartest thing you've ever said! You know what they say, every now and then even a blind pig snorts up a truffle.
And that is the weirdest.
That's right.
It's me.
- Yo, Locker Man! - I'm on it.
- I owe you.
- I'll be back to collect.
Locker Man! You're amazing, Oliver.
I've been told that.
Having trouble with your locker, Chad? Yeah.
Could ya? Well, Locker Man is on the job, but not for you, sucker.
Oliver, see that girl, Pamela, over there? - She thinks you're cute.
- Can't say that I disagree.
Too bad I'm already cruising down the Hannah Highway.
What about Kyla Goodwin? She is so desperate, she'll go out with anybody.
My type of woman, too bad I'm taken.
Hey, what about Lilly? You guys would be perfect together.
- Excuse me? - You're both stubborn.
- I am not! - I am not! See, you always agree with each other.
- No, we don't.
- No, we don't.
I am definitely seeing a couple here.
- You're not? Because I'm not.
- You're not? Because I'm not.
- Phew.
- Phew.
And that's smart.
Because what if one friend loved another friend but they didn't get loved back? Then things would get all weird and uncomfortable, and the friends couldn't be friends anymore.
And there is nothing more important than our friendship, Oliver.
Oh, man! You love me! (BOTH EXCLAIM IN DISGUST) No! I mean, I do love you, but like a brother, or a pet fish.
You know, I'd cry if I had to flush you down the toilet, but I don't want to kiss you.
That's a relief.
Because you're my buddy, and I think Hannah and you could wind up being close friends.
- Closer than you think.
- Great! Once Hannah and I are together, we'll have you over for some sushi.
Yeah! Soon, my love, we'll be together.
You enjoy that.
This isn't over, pal! Goodbye.
Hello again! (LAUGHING) I know that look.
Either you have a great idea, or you really gotta go.
Oliver is about to totally get turned off to Hannah Montana.
And I really gotta go! I can't believe he wouldn't take the car back.
I thought I made a very convincing argument.
Well, technically, Son, getting on your hands and knees and begging for a do-over is not really an argument.
Hey, there, neighbor.
- Oh, man, it's Mr.
Dontzig.
And he's wearing his robe again.
Yeah, well, count your blessings.
At least this time it's the long one.
So, Stewart family, what would another leaf from your tree be doing in my hot tub? I don't know, maybe it wanted to party.
Oh, come on, Dontzig, just trying to be neighborly.
That's nice, but I hate neighbors.
That's why I got the big hedge.
So, something needs to be done about this.
Yeah, and I think something needs to be done about this.
I would recommend possibly some sit-ups or maybe a bigger robe.
Ha, ha.
Very neighborly.
Oh, got a new car.
You know my wife, she had a car just like this.
Traded it in.
She thought it was too girly.
Get your leaves out of my hot tub! I'll have you know that we Stewart men don't define ourselves by the types of cars we drive.
That's it, this dolly wagon's going back where it came from.
But the salesperson already said no.
To you, not to me.
Face it, Son, I'm a bit more intimidating.
(HONKS HORN) Lord, take me now.
I came as fast as I could! - Is she still here? - Right down there.
I can't believe you saw Hannah Montana break up with her boyfriend right here on our beach, at the exact moment I was getting home from the orthodontist.
I know.
Knock, knock.
Who's there? Fate.
Fate who? Just go! This is it.
Good luck, Oliver.
But remember, if things don't work out, you're still Smokin' Oken.
- Thanks.
But it's gonna work out.
- Absolutely! But if it doesn't Smokin' Oken.
'Nuff said.
Hi, it's me, Oliver.
I heard about your breakup and I'm here for you.
If you need a hug, my arms are open.
- Get away from me.
- I can do that.
Hannah? Hi, the kid from the moon roof.
Look at you all upside right.
Oh, where are my manners? Sit down, sweetie, join the party.
Here, you want some gum? Load yourself up.
I didn't know you liked gum.
I've surfed all your websites, and none of them mentioned you're a chewer.
Oh, I'm a chewer all right.
I love to chew.
I chew all the time.
Like a train.
Chew, chew, chew.
I chew in the morning, the afternoon, the evening.
If it can be chewed, it's in my mouth.
Good to know.
You might want to think about updating some of your websites.
Why? Does it bother you? It really turns off some people.
They can't even be around me.
They love me, but I disgust them.
Well, I'm not like that.
You're not? - Because it's okay if you are.
- No.
Relationships are about sacrifice, and I accept you - just the way you are.
- Good to know.
Move over, boys.
New chew coming through.
Mmm.
Your mouth.
It's a Turning black? It's licorice mint.
I love licorice! Don't make me laugh, it comes out my nose.
(CHUCKLING) - You wanna see? - No! Too late! She's about to blow! (IN NASAL VOICE) Am I grossing you out? Because I totally understand if you want to transfer your obsession to Mandy Moore.
You know, she's blonde again.
No, no, no.
My love is bigger than my disgust in your black dripage.
Black dripage, watch this! Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice.
(SCREAMING) How do you like me now? I I - Still love you! - What does it take with you? What more do I have to do? You and Hannah Montana are never gonna be together.
Why not? Because I'm Hannah Montana.
Me.
Miley.
Okay, that went well.
So you were Hannah in the limo, - when I was upside down? - Yeah.
And backstage when I was hanging out of the window? - Yup.
- And when I hid in your bass drum and rode on your tour bus all the way to Phoenix? - You did what? - Nothing.
How come you didn't tell me? I'm sorry.
It's just that I knew that you were so in love with Hannah that I was afraid that maybe you might Be in love with you? - Do you think I am? - You tell me.
I mean, have you ever pictured yourself with Miley, your friend, the dork? You're not a dork.
Oh, come on, what about the time I tripped in the biology lab and spilt frog juice all over you? Oh, right, Mom made me take off my pants in the school parking lot.
Or when we were at Andrew's birthday party and you accidentally knocked me into the pool in your one-man stampede for the cake? That's not fair.
It was an ice cream log cake! And you know I have to get an end cut! Come on, Oliver.
Let's face it.
The girl that you thought you loved is standing right here, and the truth is you don't love her.
Wow, I think you're right.
That's two years of my life I'll never get back.
Sorry about that.
So what do you think? Are we gonna be okay? Yeah.
We're okay.
- Anything? - Nope.
In fact, it's a little awkward.
Let's go grab a hotdog.
So, Mandy Moore, you don't happen to have her number, do you? Boy, you bounce back fast.
Where is my dad? It's been hours.
He couldn't sell it.
That's what it is.
He couldn't sell it, and now he can't face me.
You don't know that.
Maybe something good happened.
Maybe he parked it somewhere and a bunch of cheerleaders stole it.
You think so? Oh, here he comes.
Still driving it.
I knew it.
Failure! (SOBBING) You're a failure as a father! Now get a grip, Son.
They wouldn't take the car back, but I did do something to beef it up a little bit.
(MACHO HORN HONKING) Dad, changing the horn is not gonna make it a guy car.
I know.
But this might.
(RHYTHMIC MUSIC PLAYING) (EXCLAIMING) (CHUCKLING) Dang, this is tight.
- Son, I primped your ride.
- Oh, yes, he did! (LAUGHING) Oh! Thank you! Thank you, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Okay, Son, you can let go now.
It was cute when you were five, now it just throws my back out.

Look at the size of this bad boy.
He put up quite a battle, too.
It was him, then it was me, then it was him, then it was me.
Dad, you got him at the fish mart.
Yeah, but you should've seen the size of the lady that tried to take him from me.
It was her, then it was me, then it was All right, all right, Dad, I get it.
So what's it gonna be, Bucky, pan fried or barbecued? Dad, remember what we said about naming the fish? What? It makes them a little harder to eat.
Dad, I know I have mid-terms Monday, but the new Ashton Kutcher movie is previewing tonight.
How many "prettys" do I have to put before "please" for you to let me go? - Well - Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty please, Dad, please.
- Whoa! - I can go? No, you can stop.
- You know you gotta study.
- Yes, Dad, but if you think about it, mid-terms are halfway to finals, so I only need to study about as half as hard.
And since I study twice as hard as everybody else, I only need to study a quarter.
So I'm done.
See how that works? No, and you know what? I'm the dad.
And you lose.
See how that works? You see, little sister, Dad, as a single parent, is just trying to make sure that you have the proper guidance.
And I, for one, commend him on his commitment to education.
Son, I'm glad you see it that way.
Because I'm committing you to staying home and studying this weekend, too.
Ha, ha.
- But my mid-terms were last week! - Yeah, no kidding.
I had to wrap the fish in something.
See? Minus.
(SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) I know, Dad, but what I'm saying is, who really needs history? It's so yesterday.
And I'm about the future! Yeah, and so am I.
And right now I see you at 35, living with me, no job, still stealing my change off the counter.
(WHISTLES) This is a book.
Go forth and learn.
Remember my "ha, ha" from before? I now add one more "ha," making it a full, "ha, ha," wait for it, "ha.
" Anybody seen my PDA? - Here.
- Thanks.
Now, Dad, I know you already said no, but I've been studying a lot since then.
I sneezed a while ago and algebra came out.
Well, next time, sneeze a little smart on your brother.
He could use all the help he can get.
I'm heading out for my meeting.
I should be back around 11:00.
I'll be on my cell if anybody needs me, so try not to need me.
I don't know.
You guys think I'm being too tough on ya? - Yeah.
- Yeah.
Good.
Then that means I'm doing my job right.
Study hard now.
(SINGING) Pumpin' up the party now Hey, get up, get loud Pumpin' up the party now Hey, get up, get loud Pumpin' up the party now Hey, get up, get loud Pumpin' up the party now Hey, get up, get loud Pumpin' up the party now - Wow.
Eight minutes already.
- Yup.
Time to turn in.
Good thing I'm not an outtie.
(LAUGHING) (DOORBELL RINGS) - Cover him up, we've got company.
- She don't like me.
So what's the deal? Your dad say yes or no? Yeah, let's get those feet moving! My mom's in the car grooving to the oldies, and it's getting uglier by the decade.
Lilly, my dad said no.
You think he said no, he really said go.
No, go, it's a mistake anybody could make.
Come on.
I just can't go.
I heard Ashton Kutcher's gonna be there.
Okay, now you're just being cruel.
But that's good.
It's working, keep going.
Do it, do it.
Ashton, do it.
Just one more time.
- Do it.
- Okay.
Okay, now all we gotta do is sneak you out without Jackson knowing.
- Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! - He'll never notice.
He's got a friend over.
(WHISPERING) Gotcha.
- I didn't hear.
Got what? - Milk.
I'll tell you in the car.
Come on.
Well, gotta go.
Straight home to drink some milk.
- How am I doing? - Shut up.
Well, I'm just gonna go upstairs and study.
Well, I'm just gonna stay down here and not care.
(CELL PHONE RINGING) Oh, yeah, big dawg.
(BARKING) What's up, Cooper? Hey, check this out, J-Man, I just found out that Wait, hold on a sec.
Theater three? I'm guessing it's very close to theater two.
Can't you see I'm on the phone? I swear people get dumber and dumber every day.
Hello! You're costing me minutes here! You gotta get down here.
And I'm telling you this on the DL, see Keep the walker moving, lady.
If you were supposed to hear, it'd be on the speakerphone.
There is a very hot rumor that Mr.
Ashton Kutcher is dropping by here tonight.
And I should care about this because? Because this place is gonna be crawling with fine ladies trying to get next to Ashton.
And when they can't find him, - they'll settle for us! Oh, yes! - They'll settle for us! Oh, yes! - Don't you feel me on this? - I don't know, Coop.
I mean, if I split, Miley's just gonna tell my dad.
Of course, she is in her room for the rest of the night.
And she's such a goody-goody, little Miss Perfect, always kissing up to Dad.
Just once in her life you'd think she'd go out on a limb or something.
But will she? Mmm-mmm.
Because she is gutless.
You know what? She won't even know that I'm gone.
I just talked me into it! Cooper, you are a genius.
It's like cheerleader tryouts.
Right.
Except we don't have to wear those itchy man-sweaters or do the splits.
You know, I still can't ride a bike.
The things we do for love.
- Oh, yeah! - Oh, yeah! Now, how to proceed is the question.
Watch and learn.
Hey, Ashton! Mr.
Kutcher! My man! The Kutchinator! Kutchy kutchy you! What's that, my close personal friend? Come to your party tonight? Sure.
I'll just find myself a little hottie, and we will party like it's (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hey, Barry.
Can I maybe give you a call back? Ladies? Very smooth.
You know, I was watching and learning, and what I learned was that I should not have watched.
All right, have a little patience, my man.
It's just a minor set-back.
Prepare to be impressed.
So, Mr.
Kutcher! The Kutchking! Volcanic Ash! (BOTH SCREAM) At this rate, I've got a better chance with the lady with the walker.
I bet she hasn't passed theater five yet.
- What are you doing here? - Me? What about you? - I'm telling Dad! - I'm telling Dad! - No, you're not.
- No, you're not.
Because we're not really here right now.
Right.
But Dad is.
Uh-oh! (LILLY EXCLAIMS) What can I say, Dad? She snuck out, I followed her here, I'm just as disappointed as you are.
- What are you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing? I'm getting ready to sell you out.
Listen, buster, if I go down, I'm taking you with me! What's he doing here? He said he had a meeting.
All right, just calm down.
All we have to do is wait till he goes in.
He'll never know you were here.
Lilly? Miley? (SHUSHING) - Miley's dad's here.
- Great.
He doesn't know we're here.
And we're gonna try to keep it that way.
I don't think we're off to a good start.
We have gotta get out of here.
Wait, my bag.
(CELL PHONE RINGING) - Don't answer it.
Keep moving.
- I have to answer it.
He thinks we're at home.
- Hey, Dad! We're home! - Studying at home.
- Where we are, home - Sweet home! - Home! - Home! Yeah, I just called to check in on you guys and let you know that whatever it is that you're doing that you don't want me to know you're doing, stop doing it.
Study hard now.
Bye.
I hate lying to him.
You're on your hands and knees in a movie theater! The honesty ship has sailed.
I just can't figure out one thing.
Why are we hiding? Oliver, you naive, simple boy, with a very good point! Best of luck.
- Perfect.
Can this night get any worse? - Depends on how you feel about that.
(INAUDIBLE) I don't believe it.
I know.
The old man can get a date and I can't? Why would Dad do this? Why did he go on a date and not tell us? I don't know.
Please stop stuffing your face.
- I'm eating away the pain.
- Doesn't this bother you? Miley, it's been three years.
He's probably lonely.
Well, then we'll get him a puppy! (CAR DOOR CLOSING) I hear him! Look, just remember that whatever happens he can't know we were there.
So just play it cool.
I will, I will.
He won't suspect a thing.
Where have you been? We agreed home by 11:00.
And it's - 11:03.
- Exactly! Three minutes of pure agony! Yes, but the important thing is that while you were out, we weren't.
Right.
And you were at a meeting.
How did that go? - Fine.
- Fine? One syllable? That's all I get? Okay, it was really fine.
Three syllables.
Keep the change.
Daddy, you're always talking about how we don't share enough, and you're right.
We should, starting now.
You go first.
Okay.
It was a very productive meeting, and who knows, in time it could amount to a little som'n-som'n - Like what-what? - I don't know.
You know how if you talk about things too early it might jinx it.
But don't worry, if it keeps going the way it's going, I'll tell you all about it.
- Love you guys.
Good night.
- Good night, Dad.
Love you, too.
(ROBBIE WHISTLING) Well, great.
This is terrible.
He's happy! I just wish I knew something about this woman.
What does she do for a living? Does she have any kids? Any dogs? A sound-proof basement where no one can hear our scream? I don't even know her name.
- Margo Diamond.
- What? "Movie Saturday night.
Margo Diamond.
" Hey, isn't she that real estate lady, you know, the one on the bus bench in front of the library? Your dad's dating a homeless real estate lady? Wow, that's weird.
She sells houses, but she doesn't have one.
I meant the ad on the bench, Miss Einstein.
This is perfect.
Now you can go meet her.
Jackson can drive you.
(SCOFFS) Let me paint you guys a little picture here.
"Hi, I'm Miley Stewart.
" (GIGGLING) "And I'm her brother Jackson.
"And we snuck out to the movies last night "and saw that you were on a date with our father.
"Now why are we telling you this? "Out of some insane desire to wanna get caught "and be grounded for the rest of our natural lives!" Okay, how come you always get to be the apple? Wait a minute.
Bellybutton boy makes sense.
Okay, maybe you are right.
Maybe we can't go down there and talk to her.
But I know somebody who can.
This is the dumbest thing I've ever done for you.
This is the only thing you've ever done for me.
And don't pretend you're not the least bit interested in our future possible step-mom.
Well, of course I am.
You're not the only one who cares about Dad.
I want him to be happy, too.
And if she happens to have a hot daughter who likes to invite her friends over for pillow fights, well, everybody wins! Hello! Back to Earth, Captain Hormone.
All right, let's do this.
Just remember you're my chauffeur.
Hi.
I'm Hannah Montana, and I'm looking for a house.
(LAUGHING) That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard! Lady, you're not gonna sell many houses with that attitude.
We'll talk later.
Sorry.
Telephone.
Hi.
What a thrill to meet you.
My niece is a big fan of yours.
Really? Well, how old is she? What does she look like, and do you happen to have a picture of her? Not why we're here.
But if we are going to be in business together, I need to know a little bit about you first.
For example, who's this? Your husband? - Does he know you're dating? - Wait a minute.
That's my brother.
A likely story.
Who keeps a picture of their brother on their desk? He gave me a kidney.
So you're scarred.
You know, that's getting a little personal.
Can we just stick to houses? Certainly.
What's yours like? Any kids running around? Daughters who like pillow fights? You know, maybe I am not the right person to be selling you a house.
Let me put you in touch with Habib, Prince of the West Side.
- You're gonna love him.
- Hey, I'm not finished yet.
On second thought, yes, I am.
Ms.
Diamond, excuse me and my chauffeur.
We have to confer in private.
And I must insist that you let no one know that I was here! Absolutely.
I'm trying to forget about it myself.
"I don't know what to say, Dad.
It was her idea.
I tried to stop her.
"I'm just as disappointed as you are.
" I am amazed that you can stand without a spine.
Hi.
I brought you these.
(EXCLAIMS SOFTLY) I think we can spend a little more money than that! I don't think that's hardly fair, I mean, there was the movie last night, popcorn, you wanted the big drink.
No, no! I'm on the phone.
They're lovely.
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah, Habib, let me call you back.
Jackson, you're on my foot! I can't move.
I've got a "For Sale" sign in my backyard.
- I had a nice time last night.
- So did I.
Man, he really likes her.
You know, Miles, she does seem pretty nice.
I don't care how nice she is.
She ain't ever getting any of my kidneys! I would love to go out for coffee.
Let me just get someone to cover for me.
You're not gonna believe this, but I have got Hannah Montana hiding in my closet.
Huh? Yeah, she's what we call a half bath short of a condo.
I blame the parents.
- Yeah, me too.
- Let me get my coat.
All right, come on out.
Now.
(EXCLAIMS) Dad, what a relief.
You'd never believe how lost I was.
Would it help if I said I was happy for you? How could you? Whoa, now hold up, little girl.
How'd you find out? - Well, you didn't tell me.
- I can explain.
Okay, explain this.
Why are you dating someone without telling me? Explain how you could ever think that there's someone out there who could ever replace my mom.
That was awkward.
(GUITAR PLAYING) (SINGING) I miss you I miss your smile And I still shed a tear every once in a while And even though it's different now You're still here somehow My heart won't let you go And I need you to know I miss you (HUMMING) I miss you That's a beautiful song, honey.
I like coming out here at night.
It's a good place to try and figure things out.
Maybe we could figure things out together.
Why didn't you tell me? I guess I was hoping to tell you at just the right time and just the right way, so you'd understand and not end up out here on the deck all alone.
(SIGHS) I guess there was no right time, was there? I just can't picture you with anybody else but Mom.
Neither can I.
What she and I had was special.
I can't replace that.
- Then why are you dating? - Because life goes on, and we gotta try and figure out some way to go on with it.
Don't you think your mom would've wanted that for us? Yeah, I guess she would've.
She was pretty smart that way.
- I really miss her, Daddy.
- I miss her too, kiddo.
What's this rope ladder doing here? Dad, let's not ruin the beautiful moment.
You're right.
I'll ruin it tomorrow.
( JACKSON LAUGHING) So what do you wanna do? Oh, I don't know.
What do you wanna do? Can you believe that we don't have dates on a Saturday night? If only they knew what they were missing.
Sorry I ever taught you that, Son.

You sure like nachos.
Problem is, they're not-cho' nachos.
She can't hear you.
She's chowing down on the "all you can eat" love buffet.
It's true.
When she's like this, she's doesn't know what she's doing.
I'll show you.
- Miley! - What? Just go ask Josh out.
I can't.
I'm from Tennessee.
We don't do that.
Well, you're in California now and we do do that.
- What? - You said "do-do.
" Grow up.
You're the one that can't ask a guy out.
He's not just a guy.
He's a ninth grader.
I can't just put eighth grade moves on him.
Good point.
And besides, he probably doesn't even know you're alive.
You're like some dried up insect on the windshield of his life.
Not even in the center, you're way off to the side where the wipers don't reach.
(IMITATING WINDSHIELD WIPER SOUNDS) - Lilly.
- What? This is officially the worst pep talk ever.
All right, you want a pep talk? You're Hannah "Teen Pop Sensation" Montana.
You're gonna be out in front of thousands of people Saturday night.
- Just pretend he's one of them.
- You're right.
That's all he is.
One guy.
I can do this.
I'll just channel Hannah.
Hello, Josh Woods.
You ready to rock tonight? What? Thank you! Good night, everybody! (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Then I ate a napkin and then Jackson was all, "You said do-do," and then Lilly was all, "Bug on a windshield," and then I was all, "Good night, everybody!" And that's why we have to move.
Sorry, darling.
(PHONE RINGING) - What? - Nothing.
Hello.
Hold on.
Mile, it's for you.
I can't talk to anyone right now.
Could you just make something up? Sorry, Josh, she's in the bathroom, could be a while.
No! Hold on, sounds like she's finishing up.
Give me that phone.
Hi, this is Miley.
"It could be a while.
" You, sir, do not know how good you are.
Well, next time I'm letting the machine pick it up.
You realize how much easier life was when she believed boys still had cooties? I can't believe it.
I'm going out with a ninth grader! (WHOOPING) Well, don't believe it, 'cause I'm not letting you go! (WHOOPING) - But, Daddy - But nothing.
He's a year older.
In teenage boy years that adds up to, let's see, carry the one, equals, ain't gonna happen.
This is so unfair.
Sad face.
Not-buying-it face.
Come on, Dad, it wasn't that long ago that I was a ninth grader.
And if he's anything like I was, you need to meet that boy.
He's coming up from the walk.
He is so cute.
But we've gotta be calm.
Just be calm.
Honey, if I was any calmer I'd be dead.
Hey, Dad, big favor, don't try to be funny with Josh.
'Cause you ain't funny.
I don't know, I crack myself up all the time.
What do you call a pig that knows karate? Pork chop! Ha! Daddy, please, I'm begging you, don't talk.
I'm just gonna sit on the couch and look casual, like I live here all the time.
Good thinking.
Hey, Miley.
Whoa, you look hot.
Well, hi.
I'm the hot chick's father.
How do I look? Very handsome, sir.
Nice try.
Now take your foot out of your mouth, come on in here, and let's start over.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
I'm Josh, sir.
Well, you met, you bonded, enough said, bye-bye.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast.
Why not fast? Fast is good.
Fast food, fast lane, fast forward, bye-bye.
Wow, cool guitars.
Oh, you like guitars, do you? Oh, yeah.
And these are pretty good ones.
Not as good as a Deifenbacher, but you know that.
No, I don't know that.
There goes the other foot.
Look, sir, I'm not saying it wasn't a good guitar in its day.
In its day? Ooh, sounds like you've been a musician for a long time.
Like 30 years.
Oh, wait, that's me.
Well, isn't that interesting? You have your opinion and he has his.
You gotta love a guy who isn't afraid to say how he feels.
I'm a little afraid to say anything right now.
No, you're not.
If everybody says that they like hamburgers, he's not afraid to say that he likes hotdogs, right? Okay.
And some people like skiing and he's not afraid to say that he likes snowboarding.
Yeah.
And some people like Hannah Montana and I'm not afraid to say she stinks.
What? Son of a gun, that boy's got three feet.
Hello, I am the Jackson-ator.
These will not be back.
(IMITATING OZZY OSBOURNE) Whoa, rock and roll! Sharon! - Are you always this funny? - Well, it depends.
- Do you like funny? - Oh, I love funny.
Well, then I am hysterical.
Did you hear the one about the pig who knows karate? - Pork chop? Ha! - Ha! Can you spell "destiny"? I'm Jackson.
I haven't seen you around here.
I'm Olivia.
I go to school back east.
I'm here on break looking for something fun to do.
Well, look no further.
Mr.
Fun gets off in about ten minutes.
Sounds great.
I'll just go pack up my stuff.
All right! Yes! I'm awake! (EXCLAIMS IN PAIN) Hey, my brother from another mother.
What's cracking? Coop, I just hooked up with the most amazing girl who's totally into me, and I didn't even have to tell her that I owned a Ferrari, or have six months to live or any of the usual stuff.
That's my dawg.
Putting it down for the ladies.
You should've seen me.
And tonight, she's gonna find out that even my moves have moves.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
(WHOOPING) (STAMMERING) Don't do that in public.
Oh, hey, check it out, there she is.
- Whoa.
- You bet, "Whoa.
" No, no, no.
I mean, whoa, that's my little sister, fool! I meant, whoa, I didn't know.
- Olivia.
- Yes, big brother? Get over here.
Did you agree to go out with this guy? Is that what he said? Shame on you.
What kind of girl do you think I am? - But I thought - Oh, I know what you thought.
And you better stop thinking it about my little sister.
Mmm-hmm.
'Cause when my big brother tells me to stay away from somebody, I stay away.
Mmm-hmm.
(IMITATING OZZY OSBOURNE) Sharon! I'm so confused.
This is so frustrating.
I spent all day yesterday trying to make Josh like Hannah Montana.
- How'd it go? - It went really well.
He loves Hannah Montana now and we're getting married.
How do you think it went, you donut? I'm gonna go with not so well.
(IMITATING BELL DINGING) - We have a winner! - Lilly, I'm serious.
How am I gonna go out with a guy who doesn't like half of me? He doesn't know he doesn't like half of you.
So just let him think the half of you he likes is all of you.
As long as the other half keeps her mouth shut, the three of you should make a beautiful couple.
I never get chick math.
She's right.
Why should I have to give Josh up? Yeah.
And it's not like he's ever gonna be in the same place with you and Hannah.
Hey, Miley.
You know what you said about Hannah Montana? I decided to give her a chance.
Really? That's great! Yeah, so tonight I'm taking you to a Hannah Montana concert.
Really? That's even greater.
Thank you.
(MOUTHING) And she thought it didn't go well.
Who's the donut now? Still you.
(CHANTING) Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! This is what an actual Hannah Montana concert looks like.
You mean, you've never been to one? Well, I've tried, but somehow I've always been busy doing something else.
Well, tonight, this is all you have to do.
You know, I was really nervous when you first asked me, but I'm just totally glad I said yes.
Me, too.
I just hope she's not one of those divas who keeps everyone waiting.
- I totally hate that.
- Me, too.
I'm gonna go get a soft pretzel.
You're on.
Oh, my gosh, it's Josh.
What a coincidence.
So, what do you think of Hannah Montana so far? She hasn't come on yet.
Right, I'm supposed to ask you that later.
- You seen Hannah? - Not since sound check.
She's on in one minute.
Where is that girl? Did you just come out of that dressing room? Yeah.
I was just in there and you weren't there.
Yeah, I was.
You're losing it, Daddy.
- You think I'm losing it, Fred? - It's Jimmy.
Call the cows home, Robbie Ray, you are losing it.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING) Hey, everybody.
Sorry I'm late.
Hope nobody thinks I'm a diva! That's right, sausage, pepperoni, and what the heck, onions.
I'm not kissing anybody tonight.
No, I am not ugly.
I'm a 6'4" beach god.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) Jackson, it's me, Olivia.
Open up.
Olivia? Hey.
Olivia's here and it's time to get your Saturday night on! I don't understand.
You were totally different today with Cooper.
Well, that was Saturday afternoon.
The moon has come up and I am coming out! I heard there's gonna be a party over here.
Well, who said that? Me.
Just now.
Come on, boy, keep up.
Popcorn, oh, with the movie theater butter.
Yeah, Cooper's not gonna be very happy that you're here.
I know.
That's why I didn't tell him.
Now, let's get you on the phone and let's people this party.
Wait, what happened to all that, "When my big brother says to stay away, I stay away"? Mmm-hmm.
Cooper thinks I'm a sweet little girl who needs to be protected.
And what he doesn't know won't hurt him.
(KNOCK ON DOOR) Jackson, it's Coop.
Yeah, well it might hurt me.
You gotta go! No way.
This is my last night in town and I'm not gonna let it be spoiled by Cooper the party pooper.
I'll hide, you get rid of him.
Well, I don't know, I've never lied to him before.
Please? For me? Well, there's a first time for everything.
You wait out there.
Okay.
Come on in, Coop.
Just getting my Saturday night on, you know.
(FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING) Get it off before you hurt yourself.
(TURNS OFF MUSIC) That's a good idea.
That's some great advice.
Well, thanks for stopping by.
Give me a call when you make it home so I know that you're safe.
Look, look, look.
I know I came down hard on you yesterday and I just wanna make sure we're cool.
We're totally cool.
Now drive safe, we'll see you tomorrow.
Slow down, I rented a few DVDs, thought we could chill.
(MICROWAVE BEEPING) Ooh! Popcorn with the movie theater butter.
You knew I was coming all along.
Believe me, I had no idea.
(SINGING) I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell I hold the key, the key To both realities The key! The girl that I want you to know If only I could show The other side, the other side I want you to see Yeah! Yeah! The other side, the other side The other side of me The other side, the other side I want you to see The other side, the other side of me And now, give it up for the fabulous fingers of Jesse J, lead guitar! (ELECTRIC GUITAR PLAYING) Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going? Nervous stomach.
Could be a while.
Thank you.
(ELECTRIC GUITAR PLAYING CONTINUES) This is the longest guitar solo ever.
I know.
He rocks! Sit down.
You wouldn't believe the line for the soft pretzels.
So, how about that first song? Pretty awesome, huh? It was okay.
Okay? Not even really okay? - I guess I'm into hip-hop.
- Hip-hop? Yeah, does she ever do any of that? I have a feeling she will tonight.
Is that pretzel making you thirsty? Do you need to go get a soda? You know what? I do.
Wait, here, you can have some of mine.
I'm sorry.
My bad.
I'm having so much fun with you, Josh.
Bye.
(BEATBOXING) (RAPPING) I bet you didn't know that this girl could really go and I'm gonna give you mo' 'cause you spent a lot of dough coming to my show Do-de-do-de-do-de-do Word! Do-de-do-de-do-de-do? Don't look at me, I didn't write that.
Hey! Ho! Say hey! Ho! Hey! Ho! Say hey! Ho! Hey! Ho! Hey! Ho! (MOUTHING) (COUGHING) Man, I think I'm coming down with something.
- Well, keep it off of me.
- I'll try.
(COUGHING) Better? I'm getting out of here before you cough up an alien.
That's a good idea.
Better safe than sorry.
- And listen, about my sister - Hey.
Not another word, please.
I know I'm a little overprotective, but I just care about her a lot.
And I appreciate you backing off.
You're a good friend.
Yeah, a real good friend.
I thought he'd never leave.
It's freezing out there.
But nothing a good party can't warm up.
Hey! (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) (LAUGHING) Hey, yeah, okay, hold on.
Hold on.
(TURNS OFF MUSIC) Didn't you hear your brother? I'm a good friend.
And good friends do not party with their friends' sisters, no matter how much they want to.
Wow, you really are a nice guy.
My luck.
And you really gotta go.
My luck.
Come on.
Well, I guess this is goodbye.
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.
Hey, I forgot my Dang! I just came over to say goodbye and he was all over me.
You are in trouble.
Well, that is so not what happened! - Olivia, wait in the car.
- Yes, big brother.
Shame on you.
(SCOFFS) Man, she's not telling you the truth.
She came over here.
- She was all over me.
I swear, Coop.
- Save it.
I can't believe you're trying to blame my sweet, innocent sister for this.
Well, I'm telling you, she's not sweet and innocent.
Okay, you know what? That's enough.
If there's one thing I know about my sister, it's that she would never be all over any guy she just met.
Pizza's here.
He was all over me.
Olivia, get in the car.
You and I are gonna have a little talk.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.
She already gave you your tip, big boy.
(SIGHS) Where've you been? You're missing the whole concert.
That drink line went on forever.
No, it didn't.
There were, like, three people in it.
Then you wouldn't mind going to get another one.
Oh, man! So, what do you think of Hannah Montana now? I'm still not feeling it.
What do you want her to do, surf the crowd? Yeah.
That'd be cool.
Surf the crowd.
Well, then I guess I gotta go get another pretzel! Having fun crowd surfing.
Please don't drop me.
Please don't drop - Where'd he go? - He left.
- What? - I'm sorry.
He said it was the worst date of his life? Really? I'm sorry.
Did he say anything else? He also said Hannah Montana stinks, but we decided to leave that out.
I mean, why hurt you any more than you already are? Leave.
Now.
- The rap was interesting - Go! I cannot believe I just blew it.
- You didn't blow it.
- Yes, I did.
I couldn't be happy with a cute guy liking just me.
I tried to make him like Hannah, too, and now he hates both of us.
Well, as far as I'm concerned, that's his loss.
But I'm butting in.
I'm sure Lilly was just getting ready to say that.
Yeah.
What was I gonna say next? That someday she'll find a guy that likes everything about her.
Won't be anything left to change.
Thanks, Lilly.
You always know what to say.
Sometimes it just comes to me.
Well, come on, girls, it's time to go.
(RAPPING) 'Cause it's the end of the show and we're walking to the do' And we're heading for the big black stretch limo Dad, remember.
You ain't funny.
And you can't rap.
(RAPPING) Do-de-do-de-do-de-do (SINGING) You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds The best of both worlds Yeah! Everybody wants to be a star.
- Next! - Next! 'Cause you know you've got the best of both worlds 

MAN ON P.
A: Hannah Montana, you're on in two minutes.
All right, now shake the nerves out.
Yes, get them out, now.
Now, loosen up the throat.
(BOTH VOCALIZING) (BOTH SCREECHING) (MONKEY-LIKE SCREECHING) Good to go.
Remember when I started coaching you, when you were embarrassed to do that? I miss those days.
Hannah! Mwhah! Mwhah! I am so happy you guys are here, are you having fun? Tons of.
Except there's this weird girl in your dressing room who keeps sticking her tongue in the chocolate fountain.
She looks like my dog in a rain puddle.
- Hannah! - You know her? - Traci and Evan, this is my friend - Lola Luftnagle.
Daughter of oil baron Rudolf Luftnagle, sister of socialites Bunny and Kiki Luftnagle, cousin of But you can call me Lola.
Strawberry? - Oops! My bad.
- Yes, it is.
So, are you guys gonna hang backstage? Oh, that'd be so cool.
We could hang together.
But, then who would sit in our seats? Good point.
And it is getting a little crowded back here.
I know what you mean.
Who let some of these people backstage? Tell me about it.
Well, hasta la pasta.
What a loser.
They seem nice.
- Maybe I should go with them.
- No, 'cause you're my good luck charm.
My chocolate covered good luck charm.
That's embarrassing.
Oh, no, no one noticed.
I'm gonna need another towel.
Okay, so just stay right here where I can see you, and no one else will.
Just pretend those little feet are nailed to the ground.
MAN ON P.
A: Hannah Montana to the stage.
It's show time.
Okay.
Nailed right there.
Okay.

Lola will be right here for you.

Gweni, Gwendola.

It's a crazy life But I'm all right I got everything I've always wanted I'm living the dream So, yeah everything I've always wanted Isn't always what it seems I'm a lucky girl Whose dreams came true But underneath it all, I'm just like you (SINGING) Come on!

Darlin', sometimes I wish you came with a snooze alarm.
- So what's this all about? - Lilly.
I don't know what to say to her.
I mean, I don't want to hurt her feelings but, she was so embarrassing backstage.
Well, how bad was it? Let's just say Lilly made a little unscheduled trip last night to Dork Flats, Iowa.
Population, her.
Come on, Mile, Lilly's just not used to being backstage.
I'm sure next time, she'll Won't follow Gwen Stefani all the way into the bathroom and ask her to sign her protective seat cover? It ain't funny.
Dad, you don't know what it's like to have someone you love embarrass you all the time.
I think I do.
(PHONE RINGING) Hello? Lilly landing in three Two One.
That concert last night was so much fun.
I had so much fun.
- Did you have so much fun? - I had fun! Did you see that dreamy boy in the third row? Woo! We don't sound like that, and he was in the second row.
Come on, people, I make pancakes with that milk! (CELL PHONE RINGING) The Hannah line.
It's always somebody so cool! - Let me get it, please! - No, no, no, I'll get it.
Yo-la! - Hey, superstar.
- Hey Trace, what's going on? We're throwing a little birthday bash for Kelly tonight.
(GASPS) Kelly? Kelly Clarkson? I can't believe I'm actually going to Kelly's party.
MILEY: Trace, hold on a sec.
I'm not sure if I can bring anybody, Lilly.
- Well, ask her.
- Ask her.
Right.
I should ask her.
Now.
So, Trace, I can't bring anybody, right? (MOUTHING) Sure, Kelly said you can bring anybody you want.
(SCREAMING) Trace, it's Lola.
I'll see you there! Oh my gosh, I can't believe I'm actually going to a big Hollywood party.
Excuse me.
TRACl: Hannah, I have a micro-problem.
I know, but Lilly, Lola is really great once you get to know her.
Right, okay, bye.
- Lilly's not invited, is she? - What do I do now, Dad? Look! And that's before the party.
I just wish there was some type of magic spell which could stop people from acting like total geeksicles! Me, too, honey.
Me, too.
Babe alert, 11 o'clock.
(EXCLAIMS) Older woman checking me out.
In your dreams, Oken.
Normally, yes, but But she's only looking at you, because you're sitting next to me.
Watch and learn, boys.
But don't applaud, it throws off my timing.
Please pretend to like me, those guys are watching.
Oh, I don't have to pretend.
- You're cute.
- Really? Yes, you are.
You're just the cutest little boy.
Look at that face.
And those chubby, chubby cheeks! - Not helping! - I'm sorry, let me make it all better.
- Do you want some candy? - No, I don't want any candy What kind is it? (SCOFFS) Yuck it up, boys, I got nougat on the first date.
Now it's time for a real man.
- It's Rico time.
- Yeah, it's Rico's bedtime.
Prepare to cry yourself to sleep.
Hi, please pretend to like me, my boss's kid is watching.
- But I do like you.
- Oh (GIGGLES) - I'm Nina.
- Jackson.
Look, I don't mean to be pushy No, please, push.
I like pushy.
Pushy's good.
I'm a student at the Malibu School of Beauty and I was just wondering if I could borrow your head.
- What? - Well, it's just that your hair is so fantastic and I really need someone to practice on and I'd just give anything to get my hands on it.
Well, today's your lucky day.
Anything is exactly my price.
(GIGGLES) Here, have a seat.
- How do I do it? - You got me.
Or, I got you.
(RICO LAUGHS EVILLY) (GASPING) Wow.
That's That's interesting.
I'm so sorry.
My parents were right.
I don't have what it takes to be a beautician.
No, no, of course you do.
Don't worry.
We'll fix this.
We'll fix this, right? Yeah, let me just go home and practice on my dog one more time.
I'll see you tomorrow.
(SINGING) Party, party, party! Party, party, party! Everybody, now! Party, party Hey, what's wrong? - Lilly, we have to talk.
- Well, let's talk on the way to the party.
- No, Lilly, we have to talk now.
- Why, what's the matter? Okay.
You know how we promised to always be honest with each other? - Yeah.
- No matter how hard it may be.
You trying to tell me that this shirt does not go with this hair? Okay, I'm just gonna come right out and say this because you're my friend, Lilly, and I owe you that much.
Truth is The party's been canceled.
Hannah, I've been looking all over for you.
What are you doing out here? (SIGHS) I'm waiting for my dad to come pick me up.
But Kelly's not even here yet.
I know.
I guess I'm not really in the party mood.
Okay, love you, but you're downing my vibe.
TTYL.
(CELL PHONE RINGING) - Hello? - So, what you doing? Lilly.
I'm not doing anything.
Nothing.
Just Just studying.
I mean, no party.
Just me.
Party of one.
(LOUD DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) - What's that? - Oh, that's just Jackson playing his stereo too loud.
Jackson, turn it down! I'm studying, fool! - So, want to go to the mall tomorrow? - Sure, the mall sounds like fun.
Hannah Montana! Say, "Cheese!" - Who's that? - Just my dad ordering pizza.
No, Dad, I don't want extra cheese! Sorry, I gotta hang up before he goes all deep dish on me.
Hi.
I was just wondering if you could be the good guy - and not print out that picture.
- Sure, sweetheart, no problem.
Oh, wait a minute, I'm not a good guy.
(CHUCKLING) Well, in that case, I'm not a good girl.
- Give me the camera! - Get off me! What are you doing? Hannah's not happy! She was just trying to even out the sides and get rid of the orange.
I'm not gonna say a thing.
- Well, thank you.
- I'm gonna sing a thing.
(SINGING) I once knew a girl named Nina And, boy, she was a find So I gave my sweetie my golden locks Now I look like a bluebird's behind A bluebird's behind A bluebird's behind Dad! Whatever happened to using your own misery to write a song? I'm sorry, Son.
I only make fun because I've been there myself.
Heck, every guy has.
But look on the bright side.
At least you got yourself a date with a pretty girl.
Well, not yet.
Well, then you better hurry up before somebody uses your head as a toilet brush.
Ouch! (SIGHS) Okay.
That's all the papers between Lilly's house and here.
Holy Moly! How desperate are you? (PHONE RINGING) Well, look who's talking! At least I'm not the one taking "Hannah's wild ride.
" (EXCLAIMS GLEEFULLY) Listen, Shmohawk, I don't care what I have to do.
If Lilly finds out why I didn't take her to the party, it'll crush her.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Well, darlin', then you better make those newspapers disappear.
Lilly in ten.
- Ready? - For what? The mall.
I gotta pick out a slammin' outfit for the next party.
I mean, I wouldn't wanna embarrass you.
No, we wouldn't want that.
So, let's go to the mall.
Yeah, the good old mall with that big newsstand and all those people talking about what's in the news and who's in the news.
On the other hand, the beach sounds like fun, too.
- But the mall has cute clothes.
- But the beach has cute boys.
To the beach! Go! Guys, there you are! You'll never guess who made the cover of the entertainment section.
Who? Hey, Oliver, go long! Too long! You know what? I'm hungry, let's eat.
Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry.
You know what? There is one hot grandpa.
There was a bee.
A big bee.
I think I got it.
You're welcome.
Seriously, I want you guys to see this! Hey, dude with the board! Never mind! You know what? It's getting really crowded back here.
Let's go look for sea glass.
Okay, cross your fingers.
I think I fixed it.
Why do I feel a breeze on my head? Why do I feel my head? (SHUDDERING) Well, at least I know you're done.
Oh, I messed up again! No, no, no, it's okay.
When it grows back out, you can try again.
- You'd really let me try again? - Well, sure.
I can't take this anymore.
You're bald! Why aren't you mad at me? It's not like you did it on purpose.
- But, I did.
- Why? Why would anybody Oh, no.
Something smells like Rico.
The kid paid me.
I never would have done it if I'd known you were so nice.
I just wish I could help you get him back.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm just too upset to think about revenge right now.
Okay, I'm over it.
Tell me again what Jackson looked like when he realized it was me.
(LAUGHING) Don't forget the scream.
That's my favorite part.
(SCREAMS) Life just doesn't get any better than this.
Okay, make me look Friday-night fresh.
You got it.
Just close your eyes, sit back and relax.
Ah, not too much off the sides now.
Mmm-hmm.
Wow, I've got enough sea glass to make a coffee table.
- What about you? - I've got enough sea glass to never, ever look for it again.
Oh, are the comics in here? We didn't get our paper today.
Nobody on our block did.
Who cares about the comics? I mean the fat lazy cats and the pumpkin-headed kid who's always trying to kick that football.
Boring! - Let's just talk, we never talk.
- We talked all day.
You know what? Good point.
I'm tired of my own voice.
Let's listen to someone else's.
MAN ON TV: Next on This Week In Hollywood, what pouty pop princess pummeled a paparazzi last But I wanted to see that! No, you don't.
Why is your couch so lumpy? Oh, speaking of lumpy.
Let's make some oatmeal.
Nothing like a big bowl of oatmeal after a long day at the beach.
(CELL PHONE RINGING) - Oh, the Hannah phone! - No! Hello, Hannah Montana's close personal friend Lola here.
Oh my gosh, Kelly! It's Kelly Clarkson! Hello.
Lilly, give me the phone.
So, Kelly Felly, sorry to hear the party was canceled.
Lilly, give me the phone! - What do you mean? Hannah said - Lilly, don't listen to her! She doesn't like me! Professional jealousy! Petty, petty girl! Okay, I'll tell her you called.
Bye.
Lilly, I can explain.
The only reason I didn't tell you about the party is because You didn't want me there? It wasn't me that didn't want you there, it was Traci and Evan? Yeah, they kind of thought you were uncool.
Even after you told them how cool I was? You didn't tell them that, did you? Not exactly.
No, Lilly, wait.
You don't need them as your friend.
You got me.
But if you were really my friend, you'd tell me the truth.
Okay, I'll come right out and say it.
(MILEY SIGHS) You spit food on people, you followed them into the bathroom, and you walked around for about an hour with a chocolate beard.
Oh, how embarrassing.
Why am I such a dork? Why do I always do that? Lilly, when are you ever gonna learn? (SIGHS ANGRILY) No, Lilly, don't be so hard on yourself.
I mean the first time I saw the chocolate fountain, I poured about half of it into my purse.
You're saying that to make me feel better.
What the heck are all these newspapers? I'll tell you what they are.
They're me not being a good friend.
I got caught leaving the party early and I didn't want you to know.
Why were you leaving early? Because it was no fun without you there.
- Really? - Yeah.
And you know what? It's never gonna happen again.
(ALL CHATTERING) We don't have to do this.
We're still best friends.
I know, that's exactly why I have to do this.
Hannah, it's so awesome to see you with her.
- What was it again? Lola Loser-nagle? - It's Luftnagle! - It is Luftnagle, right? - I think.
Well, whatever it is, she's not on the list.
You know what? I like you Trace, but if you wanna be my friend she's part of the deal.
But she's just so uncool.
Not as uncool as you were when you shot a snot rocket so big it hit both of the Olsen twins.
That's not fair.
You know I have sinus problems.
Well, we all have problems.
But a good friend doesn't bail on you when you have 'em.
I didn't bail on you with the twins and I'm not gonna bail on Lilly.
- Lola.
- Right.
Okay fine, but tell anyone about the snot rocket and you're out.
- Deal.
- Meet you in there.
(SNIFFLING) Well, what you did for your friend was real nice.
I think so, too.
Is that Orlando Bloom? (SQUEALS EX CITEDLY) I'm cool.
I'm cool.
- Just go for it.
- Thanks! (SCREAMING) - She is kind of a dork.
- I know.
But she's my dork.
Orlando! (CHUCKLING) That's real smart.
Laugh at the person who's handling your food! - You tell 'em, cue ball.
- Thanks, Mini-Me.
Hey, we may look alike but we will never be the same.
You know, I think what we learned here is that there are no winners in a war like this.
Only hairless casualties.
You're right.
Maybe we should call a truce.
Deal? Deal.
(BOTH LAUGHING) - You're good.
- You're good.

Honey, you're not actually meeting the Queen until Sunday.
- You look fine.
- Yeah, you're right.
But you don't.
Okay, darling, that may work for the Backstreet Boys, but not quite my style.
(BRITISH ACCENT) Now, Ms.
Montana, prior to your performance on Sunday for the Queen's granddaughter, you will be introduced to her Royal Majesty.
(SING-SONG) I'm gonna meet the Queen, whoo! I'm gonna meet the Queen, whoo! (SING-SONG) Not if you do that, whoo! Now, when cued, what you will do is the following.
Right foot behind left heel, knees bent, curtsy and say, "Hello, Your Majesty.
" (BRITISH ACCENT) Hello, Your Majesty.
- No, no, no.
Lower.
- (DEEP VOICE) Hello, Your Majesty.
No, I meant get lower.
Oh.
(BASS VOICE) Hello, Your Majesty.
I'm talking about the curtsy! (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hey, Ma.
Yeah, look, we're right in the middle of rehearsing to meet the Queen.
Can I No, no, no, no.
Not Latifah.
Hey, Simon, when I met that Queen, all I had to rehearse was, "What's up, girlfriend?" You get it? Yes, unfortunately I did.
Ma, I'm talking about the Queen of England.
Yeah.
Look, I'm kind of busy right now so can we Yes, I know she didn't birth me.
Mamaw means well, it's just when things don't go just the way she likes them, she can be a royal pain.
The Queen's granddaughter would like her pony groomed and brought to her room.
Trust me, there's no royal pain like the royal pain.
Gwendolyn, I'll be needing a bucket of sudsies and my pony sponge.
He thinks he's got problems.
Your Mamaw says she's flying in from Tennessee.
She's in a cab on the way to the house right now.
Dad, don't panic.
We only left Jackson home alone for an hour.
How much damage could he do? We gotta move.
Egg rolls, pizza, taquitos! I leave you at home alone for an hour and come back and this place has turned into the International House of Leftovers.
Take it easy, Dad.
It's just Mamaw.
Just Mamaw? You're talking about the woman that gave me life, and who never lets me forget it.
But this time I'm not giving her anything to complain about.
- Now get rid of this.
- I'm on it.
Hey, hey.
Hello, people! Mamaw's cab just came up.
It's Mamaw time! (ROBBIE SIGHS) Fasten your seat belts.
Tip? You want a tip? If you are not gonna use deodorant, make sure your back window's rolled down.
(CAB DOOR CLOSES) (CAB PULLS AWAY) Well, at least she's in a good mood.
Now, you all just sit here and act like you're two perfect little angels who always listen to their father.
Just pretend! - What is this doing here? - I lost the remote.
I needed something to change the channels with.
Ow! Hey, give me that! Cut it out.
Give Ow, ow! Fighting over a loaf of bread? Robbie Ray Stewart, don't you feed these children? It's a good thing I got a purse full of hard candies! - Mamaw! - Mamaw! Hey, Mom, it's so good to see you.
Oh, it's good to see you, too, sweetie pie.
Hey, by the way, you got a loose step outside.
If we weren't blood, I would sue you! (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) What do you think, Ma? Your baby boy's got himself a beach house in Malibu.
Well, my, I should say, you sure are living high on the hog.
Quite a few hogs by the looks of it.
So, how long you say you're staying? Oh, now, don't you worry, sweetie.
I'm only here for the weekend.
You can go back to taking food out of your children's mouths on Monday.
Well, this is great, Mamaw.
Now you get to come with us to meet the Queen.
Well, that sounds like fun, sweetie.
Yeah, and I get to perform my new song for her But the real reason that I am here is because Jackson has made it into the finals of a big LA volleyball tournament.
Oh, yeah! That reminds me, I have got something for you.
I have never been so proud of a grandchild in my whole life.
Did I mention I was meeting the Queen? Now don't worry about it, baby doll.
Mamaw's gonna have time to do both.
Queen's in the morning and the tournament's not till afternoon.
But, Daddy, she's doing it again.
Every time she comes, she treats Jackson like he's an angel and I'm invisible.
Robbie Ray, put that down! How big do you wanna get? Trust me, honey.
Sometimes being invisible has its advantages.
Now, way back in '64, when this old bag of bones was on the Olympic volleyball team, I wore my lucky wristband.
Oh, this is so cool! Thanks, Mamaw.
Wow, that's so great of you to bring something so special for Jackson.
Oh, well, you don't think I forgot about you now, do you, sweetie? Let me see.
What have I got in here for you? Well, I know how much you love music, so I brought you airplane headphones! Wow! I don't know what to say.
You might wanna disinfect those.
I took them off the old guy that was sitting next to me.
You can make a candle with the earwax on those things.
A twofer.
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Come on, you gotta do better than that if you're gonna be a volleyball champion.
Your Mamaw can do better! Heck, your Mamaw is doing better! (GROANING) Cramp in the leg.
Cramp in the leg.
Oh, I'm going down.
Jackson! Oh, come on now, get up, baby.
If I stop now, at my age, I'm gonna lock up like a yarn barn at 9:00.
Come on.
I'll stretch you out.
(GROANING) There you go.
Embrace the pain.
Yeah.
You're gonna thank me for this later.
(GROANING) Hey, Miley, I got your message.
Waxy airplane earphones? You're kidding, right? With little gray hairs still stuck to them.
(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) I don't understand, Lilly.
I'm always nice to her.
And I even complimented her orthopedic shoes.
Trust me, Lilly, those are Frankenboots.
Listen, Miley, I know you think she might like Jackson more, but that can't be true.
It is.
It's like I don't exist and she has him up on a pedestal.
- Oh, come on.
- No, you come on.
That's my little champion.
(GROANING) I don't even think she wants to come watch me perform for the Queen.
I don't know, Lilly.
What do I do? I have an idea! And it's so simple, you're gonna love it! - What? - Dump Granny and take me.
No, she's going.
She's going if I have to tie her up like a deer and strap her to the hood of my daddy's car.
OLIVER: Topher sets for Jackson.
Jackson leaps and right into the net! (SPLUTTERING) What? If I'm gonna announce the tournament, I need to practice, too.
If you're gonna announce for the tournament, you'll need to be alive! RECORDED VOICE: Ooh! Jackson takes the set from Topher and (MISSILE WHISTLING THROUGH AIR) (EXPLOSION) Oliver, do you have the sound of a truck running over a microphone? - Nope, I don't have that one.
- You will if you push another button.
You, kiddo, you are doing great.
You just need a little more knee bend.
And you, sweetheart, you either get your head into this game or I'm gonna have a senior moment all over your keister.
Uh I'm sorry for screwing up.
Uh, I guess I'm just a little nervous.
Well, you're supposed to be.
But you are a Stewart.
And Stewarts do not lose.
Now, you want this, don't you? - I do.
- Of course you do.
So, stop your moping! (BABY WAILING) (CLEARS THROAT) Finger slipped.
My bad.
Come on.
I'm gonna set for you.
Okay, bend those knees.
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) One, two, three, four.
(SINGING) The other side, the other side (GUITAR STRUMMING) The other side of me The other side, the other side The other side of me Yeah.
That was great, honey.
For heaven's sake, that woman is over three hours late.
Who does she think she is, the Queen of England? Well, it's still no excuse! She's right, I got the biggest match of my life in an hour.
I shouldn't even be here! Don't worry, Son, it's all gonna work out.
When? I'm starting to tighten up.
Not good.
You want me to stretch you out again? (STAMMERS) No! I'm fine! Excuse me, but the Queen has been delayed at the State Fair where her granddaughter washed down chili cheese fries with a grape slushy, producing a royal and colorful upchuck.
Oh, for heaven's sake, just hose her off and get her over here! I think what my mom's trying to say is we got another commitment, so Oh, not a problem.
I'll just tell the Queen you stood her up for a monster truck jamboree.
You think if there was a monster truck jamboree anywhere within spitting distance of this place, we'd be here? - Daddy! - I guess we'll just wait.
Duh.
Well, this is crazy.
We can't wait! Yo, Hamlet! You get your Queen on the horn, asap! Ma! Get back here, Ma! You cannot give a grown man a wedgie! She's gonna insult the Queen and ruin my command performance all because of her little Jackson.
- It's always about you.
- Me? It's never about me! Everything in this family revolves around you! - What are you talking about? - If it's not the Queen, it's a concert.
If it's not a concert, it's a CD signing.
I mean, face it, no matter how important something is to me, it always comes in second to Hannah Montana.
Come on, Jackson.
You know that's not true.
Yes, it is.
- Where are you going? - To my volleyball match.
Something that's important to me! Tell the Queen I said (BRITISH ACCENT) hello! For heaven's sake, Robbie Ray, I wasn't gonna hit him.
I just wanted to give him a little Tennessee talking to.
Yeah, last time you gave someone a little Tennessee talking to, the air marshal made him land the plane.
Ask for an extra bag of peanuts and all of a sudden you are a threat to national security.
Where is Jackson? He left for his volleyball tournament, so I suppose you wanna go now, too.
Well, if I don't, who will? I don't see either one of you heading for the door.
Ma, you don't think we wanna be there for him? Of course we do! But we're kind of caught between the Queen and a hard place, here.
And so once again, Jackson gets the short end of the stick.
- Mom, that's not fair.
- It is too fair! Now, I know you both love him, but you're so busy taking care of Hannah Montana, you're letting poor Jackson Stewart fall through the cracks! Mamaw, you're so busy with Jackson you're letting me fall through the cracks.
- Oh, Miley, sweetie.
- Just forget it.
No, hold up.
I need to do this.
Miley, sweetie.
I am sorry if I made you think that I don't care.
But the truth is, I love you very much and I am so proud of everything that you do.
Really? You've never said that to me before.
Well, I guess I'm so busy making sure that Jackson gets some attention, there wasn't enough left for you.
Mamaw, do you know how that makes me feel? - Kind of invisible? - Yeah.
Maybe that's the way your brother feels all the time.
Really? He never said anything.
What's he gonna say, sweetie? "Don't be Hannah Montana"? He wouldn't be a very good brother if he said that now, would he? No, I guess not.
And I guess I wouldn't be a very good sister if I made you stay here.
Go, we'll catch up with you later.
I love you, kiddo.
You rock that Queen's world.
I cannot wait to hear all about it.
Thanks, Mom.
It's nice to see the soft side of you once in a while.
I appreciate that, baby boy.
And you stay away from that dessert table or all of your sides are gonna be soft.
I was a chubby child.
She could never let that go.
I feel awful, Daddy.
We're gonna miss Jackson all because of me.
It's not your fault.
There's nothing you can do, unless you know some way to speed up time.
(ORCHESTRA PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC) Ladies and gentlemen, the Queen.
Sweet mercy, that woman makes a snail look like a cheetah.
- You ready, darling? - Let's pick it up, Daddy! Excuse me, partner, I'll take it from here.
Oh, this can't be good.
Yee-ha! (PLAYING COUNTRY MUSIC) Walk and wave and bow and greet.
Now, come on, Queenie, move them feet! Look at your guests, give them a smile.
Get the lead out, move down the aisle! Now swing that girl, give her a push.
There's your seat, now plant that tush! The Queen, ladies and gentlemen! Okay, hit it, Robbie Ray! (SINGING) By day, I play the part in every way Yadda, yadda, yadda, sing, sing, sing The other side, the other side I want you to see, oh! The other side, the other side The other side of me Yeah! Guitar solo! (PLUCKS SINGLE CHORD) (WHOOPS) Robbie Ray, ladies and gentlemen! You've been a beautiful audience.
Pip-pip, tah-tah, cheerio, good night! Simon, have we just been punked? There is my future champion.
What are you doing? - I have to forfeit.
- What? - Topher called, he's got the flu.
- Well, that's no excuse.
Heck, during the Olympic qualifiers, I got food poisoning.
I blew chunks all over the court.
The other team was sliding all over the place.
We won in a landslide.
Forget it, Mamaw.
He's not coming.
Can you believe it? I think I could have won this thing.
And now I don't even get the chance to try.
Oh, yes, you do, young man.
I did not fly all the way out here from Tennessee just to watch you throw in the towel.
- But I don't have a partner.
- You mean you didn't have a partner.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a last-minute substitution.
Jackson Stewart will now be playing with the woman who puts the "Ruth" in "ruthless.
" (FANFARE) OLIVER: Slamming Mamaw Stewart.
You're kidding, right? Well, I just didn't want my grandson to have to forfeit.
So I would appreciate it if y'all would go easy on us.
Sure.
No problem.
Jackson serves the ball.
It's returned over the net.
Jackson sets to Ruth.
(ROARS) She spikes it home! (MAMAW CHEERING) Hey, hey, hey.
What was that? Well, I didn't say we were going easy on you, slick! All right! Bring it on, Grandma! Oh, it's on.
It's on.
It's on like mud on a pig.
(CROWD CHEERING) We made it! Come on, there's some seats.
Hey, y'all, what's the score? If Jackson scores the next point, they win.
Oh, my gosh! You're Hannah Montana! Lilly, you've known this for months.
Hello, get over it! No, I mean you're Hannah Montana now! Oh, no, this is supposed to be Jackson's big moment.
Hannah Montana can't spoil it.
Start crawling, we'll get you to the stands.
This is it.
Jackson Stewart serving for the gold.
This is, without a doubt, the most important serve of young Stewart's life.
If he blows this (MICROPHONE DISTORTS AND DIES) Son, you sound a whole lot better when no one can hear you.
All right, sweetie, this is it.
Just like in practice.
Relax, the crowd is here for you.
Everybody is here for you.
(APPLAUSE) Not everybody.
Look again.
(SPECTATORS CHEERING) Way to go, Jackson! (BANGS) Ow! - Hey, look! It's Hannah Montana! - No, it's not! - She's under the stands! No, I'm not! (ALL SCREAMING) Way to go, Son.
I better go check your sister.
Clear the way! Clear out! Amazing! Even when I win, it's still about Hannah Montana.
No, it is not.
This is all about you, sweetie.
You won.
And nobody can take that away from you.
Now give me my trophy.
I'm just kidding you.
Jackson, I got something I want to say to you and when I do, I don't want this caterpillar on my lip.
- I'm proud of you, Son.
- Thanks.
Well, why don't I give you two some time? Besides, your grandma's in the car alone and sooner or later she's gonna sniff out those pork rinds I got hid under the seat.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to mess this up for you.
It seems Hannah Montana does that a lot.
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.
I wouldn't blame you if you hated me.
I don't hate you, Miles.
Okay, sure I'd like a little more attention sometimes, but at the end of the day, I like who I am, and that's all that really counts.
So you're not mad about today? My sister and my dad blew off the Queen of England just to watch me play volleyball.
How could I be mad at that? I think this is the nicest conversation we've ever had.
I know.
And if you tell anybody about it, I'll deny it.
- What conversation? - That's my little sis.
Coming through! Give me back my pork rinds, Ma! If you'd quit eating all this fried garbage, maybe you could catch me! You know, I do give Robbie Ray a hard time, but the truth is, he is doing a great job.
So, you ready to go down like a rodeo clown? Bring it on, sister! (RODEO MUSIC PLAYING) Somebody ain't gonna be happy when they lose.
Please, Lord, let it be the Queen.
Who's gonna save the Queen now? Don't hate the player.
Hate the game.

(PEOPLE CLAMORING) This is so cool! I've been waiting months for these scarves to come out! - I'm never taking it off! - Great! Just be sure to shower in cold water only and lie yourself flat to dry.
Okay, next! Not so fast, short stuff.
You know the drill.
Arms out.
(BEEPING) I knew it! What you hiding in there? - Braces? - Yeah, likely story.
Open! Daddy, you know I love Roxy.
She's the best bodyguard we've ever had, but ever since she got back from her Marine Corps reunion, - she's been a little - Say "ah!" Ahhh.
In your face.
She's just looking out for you, darling.
Remember, Roxy's the same person that threw herself in between you and that sneezing fan in Cleveland.
You're right.
All right, she's clean.
Doesn't floss, but she's clean.
Move along.
Hey! But I got my eyes on you.
Oh, my, that looks fabulous on you! Actually, I'm just looking.
Well, then look some place else, kid, I've got a car payment to make.
Fine.
But I hope when I'm as old as you, I'm not as bitter.
Oh, you will be.
This is incredible.
All these fans, and the store even made a mannequin of me.
That's not a mannequin, that's a Hannequin, Miss Montanaquin.
Oh, no.
What? That was cute-aquin.
No, I think my dad's shopping for my birthday present.
Oh, no, someone's gonna buy you something really expensive and cool.
Whatever will you do? No, Lilly, you don't get it.
As a dad, he knows everything about everything.
But as a shopper, well, let's just say the alarm should go off when he comes into the store.
You're right.
All that dress needs is a sheep and a bonnet and you're Little Bo Geek.
I love him, but the man should not be allowed into the teen department with a credit card.
(GROANS) Will someone please stop him? Stop who? Where? I'll get him! (SCREAMING) (CRASHING) He's clean! Move along.
You're blocking people here! (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Mom always knew the right stuff to buy me.
She had great taste.
But Dad Oh, man, he has the taste of a month-old pickle.
Look, no dad knows how to shop for a girl.
You know what my dad got me for my last birthday? A savings bond.
You can touch it, you can feel it, but you can't spend it! Pointless! Well, I'd take a savings bond over one of these presents any day.
Behold, the ghosts of holidays past.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
I need a fashion magazine! Cool, hip, trendy Okay, all better.
I can't believe you actually wore those in public.
Please.
They never made it out of the house.
Miley! Let's see that pretty new birthday number.
Daddy! Does tomato juice stain? Mamma mia! Thatsa bigga staina! Why don't you just say something to him? Because I don't want to hurt his feelings.
You should see the look on his face when he gives them to me and says, "I picked this out special for you, bud.
" Oh, the puppy dog look.
My dad gets me to shampoo grandma with that one.
(SHUDDERS) Well, you know, I don't think I can take another one of those looks or another one of his presents.
There's gotta be a way to stop him from shopping again.
Well, what are you gonna do? It's not like he's gonna take you along with him.
True, but he might take you.
Excuse me! If I can squeeze through that air vent, so can someone else.
We're gonna work on that.
Miley? Miles? All right, the coast is clear, bring in the cake.
Whoa! Whoa! Hey, hey.
Woop! Woop! Woop! Would you give Give it to me! Dude, chill, I'm just playing with you.
It's just a cake.
It's not just a cake, it's Miley's birthday cake.
And it's a chance for me to prove to my dad that I can do something around here without screwing it up.
Dude, I can help you bring in the cake, but I cannot help you with mission impossible.
I got it here, didn't I? Good, still perfect.
And it's gonna stay perfect until Miley's birthday tomorrow.
I just gotta get it in the garage fridge.
Oh, could you grab the box? I can't wait to see the look on my Dad's face when he gets a load of this cake.
Son, I don't think you wanna see the look on my face.
What are you grinning about? There he is.
Now just remember my future happiness depends on you.
No pressure.
You know, usually when someone says "no pressure" it adds pressure.
Just go! - Mr.
Stewart! - Hey, Lilly.
What on earth are you doing here? Oh, I'm still hunting for just that right birthday present for my little girl.
What a coinkydink.
So am I.
So, found anything? Nope.
Well, here's a wacky thought, maybe I can help you out, since we both happen to be coinkidinkally here.
Coinkidinkally.
That's not a bad idea.
What do you think of this little number? What do I think of that? Hmm.
What do I think? I'm gonna have to give it a thumbs down.
What about something over here? Hi.
Hi.
Just looking.
Me again.
Just wanted to let you know about our new promotion.
Yeah, it's called buy something or get out.
Hey, I have my eye on something.
Blah, blah, blah, and don't come back.
I don't know.
Maybe we should just try another store.
No! We haven't checked everywhere yet.
I'm sure we can find her somewhere, I mean find her something somewhere.
Lilly.
Whoa! What? Did you find something? Sure did.
And I hate it.
Just thought I'd let you know.
Look, pink.
Let go.
You know, I think I saw something with a big bow on it over here.
Hey, that's nice.
Where'd you find that? It just sort of jumped out at me and hit me in the eye! You think she'd like it? I think if she were here, she'd be all over it.
Then let's do it.
Man, that thing is lifelike.
I mean they even got the freckles right.
Look! No one at register two.
- Hey, cut it out! - Mommy! Don't be scared.
Stop staring at me, you freak! Kid thought I was real.
Come on, there's a spare key out here somewhere.
Okay, first you drop a cake, then you lock yourself outside of the house with the new cake.
I'm starting to think you got some cake issues.
Less thinky, more looky.
All right.
If anything happens to this one, my Dad will never let me live it down.
(CLATTERING) Please tell me the cake didn't just fall.
The cake didn't just fall.
The pelicans pushed it.
Why? Maybe they thought it was a crab cake.
Oh, you get it? Crab cake.
Go home.
Hold up there.
Has this bag been out of your sight or control since the time you wrapped it? Roxy, you're here for Miley's birthday.
You're a guest, you're off the clock.
Mmm-mmm.
Danger never takes a vacation.
All clear, and, girl, you're gonna love it! Lilly, this is awesome.
And it's gonna look so good with the jacket.
I know.
- Here you go, Mile.
- One second.
Oh, Roxy.
I got this one.
And I'll use your present to do it.
It's clean.
I told you she was gonna love it.
Ooh! You've been working out.
(LAUGHS) Yeah, I have.
Sheepskin seat covers.
You got me a present for your car? Hey, when I drive you to the mall, I want you to be comfortable.
For Christmas, I'm getting you chrome spinners.
Fine.
And you're getting a black leather skirt with matching pumps.
Mess with me! Your turn, Mr.
Stewart.
I wonder what you got her.
Wink, wink.
Happy birthday, bud.
I have no idea what this is, but that's the great thing about surprises, you don't know what it is and Oh, it's a kitty! - But what about the jacket? - I took it back.
Didn't feel right.
I picked it out special for you, bud.
And I love it! Especially the back.
Do I know my little girl, or what? Turn it around! Squeeze the nose! (MEOWS) Just when I thought it couldn't get any cuter.
(MEOWS) Okay, I'll wear it for an hour.
Make my dad happy.
And then tonight, it will mysteriously fall into the barbeque.
What if it doesn't burn? I will cut it up and eat it if I have to.
Either way, no one besides you, me and my daddy is ever gonna see me in this thing.
Hey, Mile, come on out on the deck.
I got another surprise for you.
If it's the matching pants, you're eating it with me.
Surprise! (MEOWS) - Got you, didn't I? - You sure did.
Okay, what we waiting on? Everybody down to the beach! We've got a birthday to celebrate! You don't know how hard it was to keep the secret from both of you.
You knew? Yeah.
You should've seen the look on your face.
How do you like this look? (GROWLS) Wow, that's the same look my mom had when she turned 40.
Well, what are you waiting on, darling? Get on down there and show off that sweater.
Are you sure it won't make the other kids jealous? Because you know, it might.
Honey, this is your special day.
You deserve to have every eye down there on you.
Great.
Jackson, we're gonna need that cake in about an hour.
Yeah, no problem.
Why should it be a problem? (CACKLING) You're laughing at me, aren't you? Laughing your little pelican laugh.
I hate you! (SQUAWKS) Okay, everybody, it's limbo time! Yeah, how low can you go? How low can you go? How low can you Oh! (BONES CRACKING) My achy breaky back! Hey, Roxy, have you seen Miley! Sorry.
Never sneak up behind Roxy.
Roxy sees everything.
Hey, you're all right there, sugar.
Shake it off.
Come on, Miley.
So it's a dorky sweater.
Are you kidding? I look like a kitty-kabob.
Well, no one here's gonna make fun of you.
It's not like someone's gonna take your picture and put it in the school yearbook.
Hey, birthday girl! Say, "Cheese!" (CAMERA CLICKS) Quick! Cover my tail! - Did you get her? - No.
You? No.
I took a picture of myself by mistake.
And I look fantastic.
Yo, J-man! Jackson! - In the kitchen, Coop! - Yo! Did you see the road kill your sister was wearing? What are you doing? What's it look like I'm doing? I'm baking the cake.
All right, I got milk, flour.
Now add three eggs.
All right.
One, two, three.
- Jackson - Shh.
Now, stir.
All right.
Stupid pelicans.
Pelicans eat fish, not cake! Everybody knows that.
Coop, I think there's something wrong here.
You're supposed to break the eggs, fool! That totally makes sense.
Yeah, thank you.
I cannot watch this anymore.
- Like you could do any better? - Way better.
Okay, I'm going to tell you something nobody outside my family knows.
What? You still drink Shirley Temples? They are fruity and refreshing! But that's not it! The truth is I'm a baker.
- What? - I love to bake! Pies, cakes, tarts and my snickerdoodles are off the chain! You said that your mom made those.
Are you kidding? My mom can't make ice.
Now step off and let a pro have a go.
I need a clean bowl, fresh ingredients and Give me that.
You're not fit to hold the whisk! Ya mon, that's right.
Nobody can beat this.
Guess again, string bean.
Roxy is undefeated.
How low can I go? Yes! Now somebody point me to the prize table.
But you cheated.
- I don't think so.
- Neither do I.
Here, kitty kitty kitty.
Miley, you can't stay in the bathroom forever.
You know the best part about being yearbook editor? - Choosing the pictures that go in it.
- Choosing the pictures that go in it.
Ooh! (BOTH IMITATE SIZZLING) - I'm getting tired of that.
- Me, too.
- Let's stop.
- Let's stop.
Ooh! (BOTH IMITATE SIZZLING) - Why don't you just take it off? - And tell my father what? I don't know, that you're allergic to cats? This is what I think of that idea.
But you gotta do something.
If they take your picture, it'll be in the yearbook forever.
Hey, it's Oliver.
Use the other one! Miley, you can come out now.
I got you covered.
- How? - Just trust me.
Here, this should cover the sweater.
Oliver, you're a lifesaver.
My Aunt Harriet got me the puppy version for Christmas.
It barks Jingle Bells.
Very clever.
Yeah, there's no way we can take that picture now.
Right.
Unless something were to happen like this.
(SQUEALS) Stop it, guys! - Yeah, why are you so mean? - It's what we do.
- Well, we don't.
- Yeah, we're her friends.
You think everybody here doesn't know it's the dorkiest sweater in the history of the world? You'd have to be blind not to see that.
Well, I don't care what anybody thinks.
I I love this sweater.
Because it was given to me by someone I care about very much.
And if you wanna take my picture, then go right ahead.
Because this sweater means more to me than the coolest outfit in the world.
Right, Mittens? (MEOWS) Wow.
It really makes you think twice about taking the picture.
I know.
- Say cheese.
- Say cheese.
(CAMERA CLICKS) Hey, girls! Picture this! (YELLS) (ALL EXCLAIM) Yeah, that's what happens when you mess with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Roxy.
My cake! That I carried but didn't make.
Because guys don't do that.
Ladies.
Say, "Gotcha!" (CAMERA CLICKS) Now we both have pictures.
- Wanna trade? - Wanna trade? Ooh! I don't do that.
- Dad.
- Hey, sweetheart.
Thanks for a great birthday.
Yeah, thanks for what you said out there.
But We both know I messed up, don't we? It's not that I wouldn't say It meows, Dad.
I know.
I saw a lot of clothes you would've liked a lot more, but I just couldn't get myself to buy them.
Why not? You see what I wear to school.
You see what I wear on stage as Hannah Montana.
Yeah.
Maybe that's just it.
My little girl's just growing up so fast, there's a part of me that just wanted to hold on to the little girl you used to be.
Daddy, I'll always be your little girl.
I'll just be your little girl that dresses better.
It's a deal.
You know, your mom and I, when she was around, we used to have a deal that she'd buy all the presents and I'd carry the bags for her.
Maybe it's time I just started carrying your bags for you.
- That could work.
- But you gotta do me one favor.
When you open your presents, you still gotta act surprised.
That's perfect.
Hey.
Does that pelican got frosting on his beak? Jackson.
(BARKING JIN GLE BELLS) (MEOWING IN S YNC) How long do you think that's gonna last? It's got a watch battery.
It could last forever.
(SHUDDERS) One more time!

(SINGING) Hey, get up! Get loud! 'Cause I'm pumping up the party now Hey, get up! Get loud! 'Cause I'm pumping up the party now Party now, party now Hey, get up! Get loud! 'Cause I'm pumping up the party now Hey, get up! Get loud! 'Cause I'm pumping up the party now Hey, get up! Get loud! 'Cause I'm pumping up the party now (CROWD CHEERING) (SPLUTTERING) - So, what'd you think? - Those pajamas are so cute.
- I was talking about the song.
- Oh.
Love that, too, but I can't wear it.
When we're at the mall tomorrow, I wanna get something cool to wear.
Oh, I forgot.
Publicity thing.
What about Saturday? Saturday, Saturday, can't! Laker game with my dad.
- How about Sunday? - Yeah, I think I Can't.
Costume fitting Sunday morning.
What about Sunday afternoon? No, 3:00 dinner with my grandparents.
I love them, but they smell like oat meal.
Oh, I love the smell of oatmeal.
Not when it's mixed with mouthwash and my grandmother's BO.
- This is crazy.
- What? We haven't had any Miley-Lilly time in, like, forever.
I know, I miss it, too.
Then how about Tuesday after school? Sounds perfect, but I'm trying out for cheer leading squad.
Oh, hey, why don't you try out with me? Cheerleading? Give me an N! Give me an O! What's that spell? "No.
" Yeah, no time together.
Come on.
You can get this! We won't regret this! We'll be together! Best friends forever! When you cheer this way, I have to say, "Okay.
" I know you must be right, but now I have stage fright.
- Say good night, Lola.
- Good night, Lola! (MOUTHING) Bye.
(SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Hi, Dad, is the sink still clogged? No, Son, I unclogged the sink hours ago, now I'm just working on my triceps.
Well, here, let me help.
- Really? - Sure.
If you lean into it like this, you get your deltoids, too.
Maybe I'll just bench press you out the window.
Are you working on your pecs or your delts? Make up your mind! Oh, heck with this, I'm already late for a meeting.
I'm just gonna call the plumber.
Can't believe it.
Drain's already clogged, now I'm gonna throw $80 an hour down it.
Plumbers make $80 an hour? I'll do it for $50.
You know what? I'm so late, I'm gonna take you up on that little deal.
Wait a minute, if I would've known you were gonna cave that fast, I would've asked for, like, $60.
And I was willing to give you $ 75.
Oh! All right, here we go.
Wait a minute.
If I'm gonna be a plumber, I'm gonna do this right.
Oh, yeah, that breeze feels nice.
Quickest 50 bucks I'll ever make.
(WHIRRING) (CLUNKS) Oh, man, I hated that broccoli casserole the first time.
We've got pride on our side! You know it! We show it! We've got pride! Okay, so, that's the pride cheer, with optional herkie.
Any questions? A couple.
First, what the heckie is a "herkie"? And second, if one of these is a pom-pom, does that make two of them pom-pom-pom-poms? These are the questions that haunt me.
- Show me what you got.
- Okay.
Go ahead.
Go team, throw the ball! Go team, to the mall! Lilly, we're doing this to spend time together.
That's not gonna happen if I'm on the team and you're not.
Okay, so just watch me, all right? And one, two, three, four.
Move and squat, arms up and jump.
Twirl, clap, arms up and jump.
- Okay, now you try.
- Okay.
Move and squat and arms and jump and clap and arms and twirl and twirling and twirling and (GRUNTS) How's that? Now why is it that when I ended up on the couch like that you grounded me for a week? That's because you jumped all the way from the piano.
Sixteen feet, a new personal best, baby! So, I'm guessing you're going to be the only cheerleader there with pom-poms and a helmet.
(LILLY GROANING) Help.
(SINGING) Hey, come on! Get out! I'm snaking out the pipes now Hey, come on! - Hey, Jackson, where's Miley? - Don't know.
- When's she gonna be back? - Don't care.
- Could you tell her I stopped by? - Don't count on it.
There, I'm through.
- Jackson? - Not right now, kid.
I'm about ready to hit pay dirt.
Jackson, turn it off! Jackson! Why does this always happen to me? I was kind of thinking the same thing.
Dominate the floor! Pirates make that score! Give it all you got! Pirates make that shot! Oh! I can't believe I broke a nail! Anyway, yay, team! Amber, that was a wonderful effort.
Every time you fell, you got right back up again.
Even when I begged you to stay down.
Everyone give it up for the effort.
Okay, moving on.
She doesn't like you 'cause you're too pretty and you threaten her.
Story of my life! Okay, Stewart, show me your stuff.
Okay.
They got our ball.
We want it back.
- They got our ball.
- You want it back! - I get it.
What else you got? - Oh, I got a good one.
And slide and slide and do the butterfly! And dip and dip and shake my little hips.
I want you and you to cheer it with me, too! (EXCLAIMING) Way to go, baby! When I asked you to bring it, you brought it.
Now take it over there.
Lilly Truscott, come on down! You're the next contestant on The Coach Is Right! Okay, Truscott, you're the last one.
The next minute of my life is yours.
Don't waste it.
Let's go.
(MOUTHING) Go! Dominate the floor! Pirates raise that score! Give it a shot! Sorry, I mean Give it all you got! Pirates, take that Make that shot! Yay! Well, wasn't that something? Can I try something a little different? Yeah, something different would be good.
Oh, no, I can't watch this.
I only taught her one cheer.
You might be good at football! You might be good at track! But when it comes to basketball, you might as well step back! Come on, step back! Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Wow, where did that come from? I just did all my skateboarding stunts without my skateboard.
Well, you know what? Put the skateboard away and grab a uniform.
You're on the squad! Yay, yay, yay! And, Stewart, I love your enthusiasm.
It is part of what makes you perfect for a position of great responsibility on this squad.
And I think you know what I'm talking about.
I think I do.
She's gonna make me head cheerleader.
Congratulations to our new mascot! Yeah! Mas-what? Everyone say hello to Pirate Pete! Arrr! Argh? We're number one, not number two.
We're gonna beat the "whoops" out of you! Testing, testing.
555-0121.
555-0121, that's my number, ladies.
And the tenth caller gets a date with moi.
(CELL PHONE RINGING) - Hello, lucky tenth caller.
- Knock it off, Oken! Sorry, Coach.
Aargh! I'm a pirate! Why am I riding a tricycle? This is not a tricycle, this is your pirate ship.
Own it, sell it, make the crowd believe it! I don't even believe it.
Dominate the floor! Pirates make that score! Give it all you got! Pirates make that shot! (WHOOPING) Perfect! Fantastic! You girls are the best.
There's not a girl in this school who doesn't wish they were you.
(RINGING BELL) Oh, hi, Stewart.
Coach, I put this on my head and it smells like a litter box.
Don't worry.
I think I've got something that might help.
Oh, man, there's gum stuck in here.
Air fresheners! Do you want to smell like a pine forest, a tropical breeze or a brand new car? I wanna smell like a cheerleader.
They don't make that scent.
Now get back out there and show me a little less Miley and a lot more pedaling pirate.
Arrr! I am so glad you talked me into this, it's a blast.
Oh, yeah, you should see it from inside here.
And the best part is, we're back to having Miley-Lilly time.
(WHISTLE BLOWS) Gotta go.
I know you feel bad about not making the squad, but look! Argh! See? I told you it would make you feel better.
Oh, yeah, that's right, you run from Pirate Pete! If this thing had a plank, you'd be walking it! Hey, Jackson, Miley left her head at practice.
- You get it? Her head? - Don't know.
- But I didn't ask that.
- Don't care.
- Will you stop? - Don't count on it.
- Oh, hey, check this out.
- One sec.
Ready.
Man, it was a little water and some unidentifiable sludge.
Get a tetanus shot and buck up, little camper.
- Check it out, it's perfect! - How did you do that? I have absolutely no idea.
I did know I had to work fast though.
Went under the house, it was dark, I got bit by spiders.
Man, I wouldn't be surprised if I wake up tomorrow with super Spidey powers.
(IMITATES WEB SPRINGING) Hey, check this out.
(WHIRRING) That, sir, was the sweet and sour sound of $50 going in my pocket.
Jackson! - What's that sound? - Jackson! - Man, I gotta get out of here! (IMITATES WEB SPRINGING) Dang it! I know that it looks like I messed up, but technically, the job was to unclog the sink and the sink's unclogged.
Now, I do take personal checks, but I prefer cash.
And I prefer not to shower in moo shu pork.
And lunch is on me.
And now it's on you.
Oh, no, it's following me.
- Hey, Mile, how's it going? - I feel like I've been dumped on all day.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
I did this cheerleading thing to be with Lilly.
And now she's a cheerleader and I'm a lame pirate.
And, yes, I'm talking to you, stinky.
Whoa, that's a relief.
I thought it was me.
I mean, I don't know what to do.
I'm not having any fun.
- I just wish I could quit.
- Well, then why don't you? - What? - I mean, heck, I don't know any friendship that's worth wearing a smelly, old pirate head.
The heck with Lilly.
How can you say that? She's my best friend.
She's more important to me than Wait, a minute.
Did you do that on purpose? - Did what? - Get all Jedi mind-tricky on me again.
Thanks, Dad.
I'm gonna go take a shower.
Unless you are in the mood for a moo shu-ey shampoo-ey, I wouldn't do that.
And your score at halftime, the Fillmore Flamingos, 58, and your Seaview Pirates, less than that.
(TOILET FLUSHING) Way less than that.
But let's not think about that.
Let's think about your lovely Seaview Pirates! That's 555-0127.
(MUSIC PLAYING) Go, go! (CANNON FIRING) What's that I hear? Uh-oh! Cannon fire? It's Pirate Pete! Argh! Argh! Let's chop up them flamingos and feed them to the sharks! Avast ye landlubbers! Shiver me timbers! Shiver your timbers over there.
I can't see the cheerleaders.
Oh, sorry.
I mean, sorry, matey.
Backing up! - Whoa! - Hey.
You're paying for that popcorn, you fat headed freak! - Shove off, matey! Hey, stop it, I No, not my soundboard! (SOUND WARPING) Sorry, Oliver! - What are you doing? A mascot never takes off her head, it ruins the illusion.
What illusion? I'm a pirate on a pink tricycle.
Look, just stay on the sidelines and watch the pretty cheerleaders.
(CHEERLEADERS CHANTING) Take a hike, Pinky.
I'm not in the mood.
I said back off! Bring it on, birdie! Why, you little Hey, stop it! (MILEY GROANING) Oh, I'm gonna get you for that.
Hey, no pecking! How do you think I got this eye patch? I'm sorry, Coach.
I was just trying to be the best mascot I could be.
And I think you were, that's what's so sad.
But I'll be better next time.
- There won't be a next time, will there? - Listen, sweetie, some people just aren't meant to perform in front of crowds.
What I'm trying to say is, Beyonc� you're not.
Turn in your head.
But have it dry cleaned first.
- Hey, what happened? - I got fired.
I'm sorry, Lilly.
I really wanted this to work out, but we can find something else we can do together.
Come on.
What do you mean, "come on"? I have to go back out and cheer.
Why would you go back out if I'm not here? Because Well, I like it.
But we only did this so we could be together.
That's before I saw how cute I look in this uniform.
So a uniform's more important than our friendship? No, but (WHISTLE BLOWS) Miley, can we not do this right now? I have a big herkie coming up! You didn't even know what a herkie was until I taught it to you.
Truscott! - Look, I gotta go.
- Well, so do I.
Well, Mr.
Stewart, you are one lucky man.
I'd feel a lot luckier if I was talking to your face.
Oops, sorry.
Was I showing again? You get so used to the breeze, you can't even tell anymore.
I know what you mean.
Your main line was so rusted, you were one flush away from flooding the place.
But the work this boy did held it all together till I got here.
Now, wait a minute, are you talking about my son, Jackson? - Yeah.
- This boy right here, my son? Yeah, he didn't screw up, he saved this place.
- This boy did? - Yes! - Jackson? - Yes! Son, you've got the plumber's gift.
My boy had it, but he decided to go to college.
Kids, they'll break your heart.
Well, I guess someone owes someone an apology.
And 50 bucks? You're right, Jackson, I never thought I'd ever say this, but good job, Son, I'm proud of you.
"Good job, Son, good job.
"Thanks, Jackson.
" You're welcome, Dad.
Yeah, I could get used to this 'cause I didn't screw up.
I didn't screw up.
I didn't screw up.
I didn't screw up! (CLANKING) Jackson, what was that? - Nothing! It's time for my Spidey escape.
(IMITATES WEB SPRINGING) Dang it, I gotta get these things fixed.
- Okay, now I'm ready to talk.
Well, now I can't.
Hannah Montana has a backstage party at the Stones concert.
Why are you limping? Because, thanks to you, I couldn't concentrate, and my herkie was jerky.
Wow, that looks swollen.
Do you want some ice? Don't you be nice to me when I'm mad at you! And, yes, wrapped in a towel.
Can you still cheer? - It doesn't matter anyway, - I'm gonna quit.
- What? You can't! What are you talking about? You're the one who told me I should.
Well, I was being selfish.
When I'm on stage performing, and I look out to the wings and you're always right there cheering me on.
Well, I just want to do the same thing for you.
- Really? - Yeah.
But I can't do that if you quit.
But if I don't quit, we'll never get any Miley-Lilly time together.
And, I mean, it's not like you can quit being Hannah Montana.
No.
- But sometimes I can, like tonight.
- What're you doing? I'm about to limp to the mall with my friend, Lilly.
You're gonna give up the Rolling Stones concert for me? Please, those guys'll still be touring when they're 90! I thought they were 90.
That's great! You're on the squad! (EXCLAIMING) Did you hear that, ladies? Smokin' Oken's on the squad.
Gross.
Now you really have something to cheer about.
Come on, it's not that bad! Is it? 

(SNORING) (CHUCKLING) Oh, yeah, baby.
I love you, too.
Oh, man, not again.
Meet your new girlfriend.
Hey, Oken, is she your main squeeze? Did you get it, squeeze? Orange? How do I come up with this stuff? Hey, leave him alone.
- Yeah, nobody picks on Oliver but us.
- That's right.
Hey! I mean, if we were going to pick on Oliver, we easily could've said, - "Oh, man, you make an ugly girl.
" - But we didn't.
Even though it's true.
Thanks.
Hey! Okay, people, it's pop quiz time! (ALL MOANING) First question.
Who can tell me why this is the worst day of my life? (EXCLAIMS) Let it go, man.
Let it go.
You got passed over for principal again, Mr.
Picker.
That's right, Oken, poke the bear with a stick.
By the way, that's not your color.
No, my rapture today is because I lost a bet with Coach Hendricks, and I am now the chaperone of this year's class camping trip.
Oh, man.
- Oh, no, don't moan.
It'll be great, sitting by the campfire, telling stories, being eaten alive by disease-ridden bugs, oh joy.
Come on guys, camping's fun.
I do it all the time.
Little Miss Miley Sunshine, trying to turn my frown upside down.
That's very sweet and at this moment, terribly annoying.
Have your parents fill out these forms so you can spend 24 glorious hours with me and no indoor plumbing.
(EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) I don't want to go to the bathroom in the woods.
- I don't even like going here.
- Come on, guys, think about it.
Sitting under the stars, breathing all that fresh mountain air, surrounded by the sounds of nature.
(MIMICKING BIRDS CALLING) (CHITTERING) - What are you doing? - A chipmunk, duh.
(WITH COUNTRY ACCENT) Could you be any more of a hillbilly? You know, I could've done a pig, but you guys already got that covered.
Mmm.
What's that I smell? Bacon that just got burned! - Geeks.
- Freaks.
- Loser.
Loser.
- Loser.
Loser.
Oooh.
(MIMICKING SIZZLE) You do that stupid finger thing one more time and your Oh, cat fight on aisle five.
Sir, we were just talking about what a kick it's gonna be getting to know each other better.
Right, guys? - Right.
Oh, yeah! Right.
- You bet! Good, you're sharing the same tent together.
- What? - What? (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (GRUNTING) Ninety-eight I see ya.
Ninety-nine I'm coming to get ya.
One hundred.
Okay, darling, it's time for me and you to do a little dance.
(COUGHING) (COUGHING LOUDER) Honey, you look terrible.
Couldn't sleep.
Feel sick.
(RASPING) You know, you sound kind of like that old mule that used to haul fat Uncle Earl up that hill to church.
And look at that rash.
That's it.
You're not going on that camping trip today.
But, Daddy, I'm fine.
(COUGHING) Sorry, darling, but you're going back to bed.
And I guess I'll just have to call and cancel that interview I had set up for Hannah Montana and Taylor Kingsford.
Taylor Kingsford? He is the coolest V J on TV! This is awesome! I mean (COUGHS) Nice try.
But next time you might wanna go for a waterproof rash.
I'm healed! Hallelujah? Miley, I know you just don't wanna share a tent with Amber and Ashley, but sometimes you just gotta make the best out of a bad situation.
Well, in that case, I'm gonna need a jar of honey, and the cover of nightfall.
You know, at times like this, I'm gonna say to you what I used to say to your mother.
Keep your mitts off my cake.
Mile, I know those girls don't always treat you right, but sinking down to their level just isn't the answer.
Dad, how do we really know that until we try? Well, you remember that kid that always used to tease Jackson? Then Jackson snuck into his bathroom, put glue all over his toilet seat? It would've worked if I hadn't slipped.
(LAUGHING) He sure gave that crowd in the emergency room a good laugh.
Good times, good times.
But my point is, if you're gonna lie down with dogs, you're gonna get up with fleas.
Not if I wear a flea collar! Mile, as a favor to me, be the better person.
But, Dad, I already am the better person, so why do I have to act like it? Promise me.
- Okay, fine.
- That's my girl.
(ALARM BLARING) Oh, man.
That dang mouse is chewing on the wires again! That's it, I guess this time I'm just gonna Oh, no, you're not.
That mouse is a living creature.
I even gave it a name.
Linda.
It's Spanish for pretty.
Well, you better start learning the Spanish word for squished.
It was the sixth day without food.
Only one man could guide the remaining survivors to safety.
Oliver Oscar Oken.
"The Triple-O," known the world over as "Ooo.
" That is so not funny anymore.
It's the Malibu Miley Cat! Very rare, very vicious! Okay, people.
One, two, three, drop! Excellent, now if only we could pick them up and leave.
Could there possibly be a better place to study nature? The answer is yes.
On a 42-inch Hi Def plasma TV in the comfort of my den, just steps away from indoor plumbing.
Come on, Mr.
Picker, you can't experience the feel and smell of nature on your TV.
That's the whole point.
Now set up your tents, get into them and pray for the next 24 hours.
Because that's what I'll be doing.
There they are.
- I've got a clear shot.
- Lilly, no, we might get in trouble.
Let me handle this.
Okay, but make it hurt.
Trust me.
You can count on that.
(SIGHING) (STUTTERING) Okay, I know we've had our problems, but Lilly and I are willing to forget if you are.
I thought you said you were gonna make it hurt! That was the most painful thing I've ever done.
But I promised my dad I'd be the better person.
Well, I didn't! Lilly, please, I can't do this without you.
- Help me because you're my friend.
- No.
Because you know it's the right thing to do.
Oh No.
Because I'm on Taylor Kingsford, your favorite show, tomorrow night and if you don't help me, I'm not taking you.
Hello, tent pals! Who wants me to braid their hair? (EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) What do you say we put up this tent, and make a fire and cook ourselves up a big pot of friendship? (WITH COUNTRY ACCENT) Well, we'd like to, but we don't speak hillbilly.
(WITH COUNTRY ACCENT) Or do our wash down yonder in the crick.
You're funny.
- I hate them.
Just remember Taylor Kingsford, your favorite show.
You know what I'm thinking, Ash? - Half-caff - Non-fat, - grande latte with just - Grande latte with just - a sprinkle winkle of cinnamon.
a sprinkle winkle of cinnamon.
That's it, I'm going to sprinkle their winkles.
Lilly.
No! (EXCLAIMS) That's a bite.
That's a big bite.
Well, this is just great.
Amber and Ashley bail, and now we have to put up this thing all by ourselves.
I mean, ask me to change the trucks on a skateboard, I can do that.
But a tent? This'll take forever! Ta-da! - How did you do that? - When you're raised in Tennessee, they teach you this stuff before you're potty trained.
Go look inside, there's cut flowers.
(WHISPERING) Linda.
Come on, Linda.
- (WHISPERING) Dad? - Shh! - Dad? - Shh! - (WHISPERING) But, Dad.
- (SHOUTING) What? I was just gonna tell you if you stop looking at the plate maybe the mouse will come.
I was right! Donny, I don't think it goes that way.
You should've stopped after "I don't think.
" Did you hear that, guys? "I don't think!" Because he doesn't think! I own you! Yeah, well, you should've stopped after "Did you hear that?" (LAUGHING) Did you hear that? Right? Give it to me! - You can pull harder than that, wimp! - Oh, wimpier! (DONNY GRUNTING) Step aside, rookies, let me show you how to do this.
- I can do it if he'd just let go! - You let go! Tent wedgie, tent wedgie! No place to buy a latte, no place to buy shoes, and not a single multi-plex.
Why would anyone want to come to the woods? There's nothing but trees.
What a waste of space.
And we're supposed to sleep in this? It's synthetic! (EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) Let go! You let go.
- What are you doing? - Pitching a tent.
- How's it working out for ya? - I'm hanging in.
Great.
I have so many bites on my tush, it looks like a waffle.
Mr.
Picker? - Did we build ours the right way? - What? Wow, I'm impressed.
But Miley put up that tent! They just went for lattes! - Lattes? - In the forest? I can't believe you would try to take credit for something we did.
All we wanted to do was put up a tent, make a fire and cook us up a big pot of friendship.
That's what I said! She's taking credit again! Mr.
Picker, make her stop.
- Please make her stop.
- If it'll make you stop, sure.
Listen, here's a thought, why don't we just apologize to each other? Or at the very least, somebody fake an illness so we can all go home.
Fine.
I'm sorry.
Right.
We're both sorry That you are two lying, evil nasties! Oh, how I wanna go home! Just a tip.
In the future when apologizing, (CHUCKLING) avoid the phrase "lying, evil nasties.
" - Here.
- What's your problem? I have to share a tent with Donny tonight.
So? He's had five helpings of beans.
Come on, Oliver, it's not like he did it on purpose.
Hey, Oken.
I think he did.
Look, we feel bad about this.
We didn't think he'd make you wash all the dishes.
- Poor babies.
- But, look, you're almost done.
Oops! Sorry.
See? I can apologize.
Well, that's because you're the bigger person.
That's it! Forget Taylor Kingsford.
I'm going after them and don't you try and stop me.
Who's stopping ya? I'm with ya! Sorry, Dad.
Get the flea dip ready, because tonight I'm lying down with the dogs.
Linda.
Come on out, Linda, nobody's gonna hurt you.
- Come on.
- Come on, Dad, that's ridiculous.
This is how you catch a mouse.
Two hundred and forty-eight traps.
Very impressive, Son.
Can you come over here for a second? (CHUCKLING) Oh, all right.
Okay, I know what you're thinking.
But I got the brains to get myself out of this one.
See, that's the difference between me and a mouse.
(TRAPS SNAPPING) I think the difference is the mouse would've made that jump.
(TRAP SNAPS) (FOLIAGE RUSTLING) (AMBER GASPING) What was that? Ashley? Ashley.
Ashley.
(MOANING) Move your hand.
I can't see your answers.
Ow! - What's going on? - I think I heard something outside! It was probably just the wind.
(OLIVER GROWLING) Or not.
- Mr.
Picker! Mr.
Picker! - Mr.
Picker! Mr.
Picker! - Mr.
Picker! - Mr.
Picker! Twelve more hours, your own bathroom.
You can do it.
(OLIVER GROWLING) - (SHOUTING) What is that thing? - I don't know.
It could be a bear or a mountain lion.
Whatever it is, it sounds hungry.
(OLIVER GROWLING) But I'm too pretty to get eaten! Hey, I'm pretty, too! Well, I'll mention that at your funeral! - Lilly, wish me luck.
- Miley, what are you doing? If we stay here, we'll all get torn to pieces.
Our only hope is if I can get to the ranger station alive.
This is stupid.
I just can't let you go.
- But we can! - Go, go! Be stupid! Don't worry, I'm gonna be just fine! (BOTH SCREAMING) - Thanks for the help.
- Anything to get out of Donny's tent.
He got a standing ovation from the skunks.
Oh, no, you don't! Yeah, that's right! Not so tough now, are ya? My leg! Ow! My other leg! My arm! (OLIVER GROWLING) - Okay, you go next.
- Why me? I think we've established the "pretty scale.
" - Lilly, he's got me! - Oh, no, he doesn't! It's too late.
Goodbye! (LILLY GRUNTING) No, Miley, no! You let her go, you (AMBER AND ASHLEY SCREAMING) Hey! Ocupado! Get out! You get out! (ALL SCREAMING) (ALL EXCLAIM IN DISGUST) Yeah! Looks like Daddy was wrong.
I got down with the dogs and got up flea free.
(GRUNTING) Got ya! (MOUSE SQUEAKING) That little sucker's laughing at me.
(PLAYING RANDOM NOTES) Oh, your tail is mine now.
(PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC) What the Way to go, Dad, I'll take it from here.
All right, my little rodent friend, kiss your whiskers goodbye.
Whoa, Son.
You don't kill a mouse with that kind of talent.
Linda, you know Achy Breaky Heart? MILEY: (SINGING) The other side, the other side The other side of me The other side, the other side I want you to see The other side, the other side of me That was Hannah Montana.
(EXCLAIMS) And in a minute we're coming back with the real thing.
So please stay tuned, because I love you! I mean it! I really do! And we're clear.
There you are, there you are, looking so fine! How you doing? And who is your right-hand lady? (GIGGLING) - Is she all right? - I ask myself that question every day.
Stay! (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hey, Oliver? What do you want? I'm kind of busy.
It's important! Remember that bush we were standing in? It's poison oak! What? That's crazy.
If it was then I'd be doing this.
Hey, baby girl, if you want to be on the show, you need to be on the stage.
Gotta go.
(SIGHING) Okay, no, just because he said it I mean Lilly isn't We're back! - Three, two - Oh, boy.
And we're back with Hannah Montana.
(EXCLAIMS) - Hannah, welcome to the show.
- Thank you.
I have been itching to ask you a few questions.
(CHUCKLING) And I'm itching to answer them.
You always come across so sweet as apple pie.
And America loves apple pie.
We love apple pie.
But is that the true Hannah Montana? Is that the real you? We'd like to know.
Well, I've always believed that at the end of the day, it's about loving each other as you would love yourself.
Boring! Come on, I mean, haven't you ever got down and done something so bad? Well, you know, I've learned recently that if you get down with the dog, you end up with fleas.
- Are you all right? - Yeah, never better! It's just this A new dance routine I've been working on, and I just can't wait to show it to ya.
- Does it come with a song? - If you want.
How about that, a Taylor Kingsford sneak peek right here! All right, all I need is a beat! - Come on, band, help her out! - Okay.
(PLAYING RHYTHMICALLY) Give me that mike! Thank you.
Okay.
(SINGING) Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! I call it the Scratch dance! Contagious, isn't it? Everybody's doing it.
See? Just scratch my back! Okay! All right! (SINGING) A little to the left Now a little to the right Lower, higher, now, that's just right! I can't watch this.
- (MILEY SINGING) Oh, yeah! - You don't have to.
I'm recording it.
I never get tired of watching me be right! (MOANING) - Now switch! - You wish.
- Scratch dancing! Scratch dancing! - Scratch dancing! Scratch dancing! - MILEY: (SINGING) Oh, yeah.
- Scratch dancing! Scratch dancing! It's contagious! - It's contagious! - If you don't stop, you're going to find out! Come on, little girl, bring it! - Come on, come on! - I'm gonna get you! - Scratch that! - That's it! (PLAYING THE EN TERTAINER) Very funny, Linda.

And trust.
All right, very nice, people.
Now that you have clearly mastered the trust exercise, you, you're ready to act.
But the secret to acting is reacting.
(SCREAMING) Did you see that? He reacted.
- He didn't think.
Did you? - I try not to, sir.
And you're great at it.
I want you all living in that mom (SCREAMS) I've got a brother.
You're gonna have to do way better than that.
Oh.
Hmm (BOTH SCREAM) Nice work.
You get an A for the day.
I'll take a B if you stop doing that.
Everybody listen up.
Now we're going to do the mirror exercise.
What one does, the other mirrors.
Acting, reacting.
Mirror.
Now, next week, we are doing scenes from Shakespeare's great play, Romeo and Juliet.
"But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? "It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
" Man, that dude knew how to pick up chicks.
- So, who do you want for a partner? - Well, not Oliver.
I mean, look at him.
(IMITATING MONKEY) I know, he's always monkeying around.
- Exactly, and I need a good grade.
- So do I.
But if one of us doesn't pick him, nobody will.
I guess you're right.
So - You pick him.
- Me? No way! Nice mirror.
I have a compromise.
I pick Henry! No fair! He went to Shakespeare Camp three summers in a row! - Why do you think I picked him? - You know what? I don't care.
This doesn't mean I pick Oliver.
You pick Oliver? Bold choice! Especially considering you're going to have to kiss him.
(SHRIEKS) I knew I'd get you! Just kidding! (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Oh, Juliet.
Oliver, we have been rehearsing for over two hours and we're still on the first page! It didn't take Shakespeare this long to write the play! Okay, just give me a second to get into character.
(WHISPERING) Why me? Hey, Juliet! Get it? I'm a fruit fly! (DRONING) Huh, fruit fly? Now you're a dead fruit fly.
Can we just please do this, Oliver, please? Okay.
I'll really try this time.
But soft, what light over yonder breaks wind? No! You know what, I'm just gonna email Mr.
Corelli and ask for another partner.
Miley, wait.
I'm just nervous, okay? - Nervous? About what? - Messing up and looking stupid.
Hey, guess what, done that.
At least when I joke around, they're laughing because I want them to.
Come on, Oliver, nobody's gonna laugh at you.
Trust me, this has been going on forever.
Four score and I'm a fruit fly! Abraham fruit fly! Okay, look, Oliver, everybody gets nervous.
When I'm up there as Hannah Montana, I get nervous, too.
- Oh, yeah, right.
- No, really.
The minute I hear I have to perform, I get a huge knot in my stomach and my heart starts pounding so hard I can hardly move.
Guess who's singing the National Anthem at the Laker game tomorrow night? Yes! Hannah Montana! Rocking the anthem! For the Lakers! But I'm very nervous, huge knot, don't know if I can do it.
- Nice try.
- Okay, so I don't get nervous.
I'm Hannah Montana, for crying out loud! I'm not a normal kid! Wow.
Romeo and Juliet.
I had to do this scene in speech class.
- And you did just fine, didn't you? - Nope.
Actually, it was the darkest day of my life.
Made it through the first two words then froze up like Aunt Pearl in the outhouse on Christmas morning.
- But everything turned out okay? - Only 'cause I started cracking jokes.
"What light through yonder window breaks wind?" That one killed them! But that was wrong.
Shakespeare is very important and you'll use it every day of your life.
Like fractions.
I'm using them right now.
I'm halfway out the room.
Three-quarters and I'm gone.
See? I'm not the only one who has a problem with Shakespeare.
Even your dad got all freaked out.
Oliver, but he didn't have me.
You're my friend.
And I'm not gonna let you fall on your face.
Here, let's do the trust exercise, go! (DOORBELL RINGS) Okay, technically, that wasn't your face.
- Hey, Rico.
How's it going? - Great, fine, swell.
Now give me my box.
Where's my secret candy box? (SCREAMS) Where is it? What happened? What did you do? It's gone! Yeah, along with the enamel on your teeth.
Look, your dad called.
Your last dental exam was so bad, they're putting your x-rays up in the lobby to scare the other kids.
The man lies! Last time we went to the movies, he put me in a diaper so I could get in for free.
I'm not buying it.
This is the same father who gave me 100 bucks to keep this away from you.
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me Please, settle down, all right? You see what this candy is doing to you? This is for your own good.
Fine.
But listen to me and listen good.
There's not one place on this earth where you could put that candy that I'm not gonna get it.
Oh, yeah? Well, what about right here? Give me, give me, give me, no, give me, give me.
- And here.
- Give me, give me, give me Hey, Dad, how you doing? What's for dinner? Hope it's meatloaf.
How was your day? Mine was good.
Nice shirt, goes with your hair.
What's for dinner? Did I already ask that? Meatloaf? Jackson, how much candy have you had today? (STAMMERING) Why would you even ask that? We both know you have a problem when you've had too much sweets.
Let it go.
I was eight, it was Easter, I'd never seen a chocolate bunny before.
Big chocolate bunny ears with candy eyes.
Whoa! Okay, let me smell your breath.
Dang, you smell like the inside of a pi�ata.
Big deal.
So I had a few dozen pieces of candy.
I can stop anytime I want.
- Hey, what are you eating? - Nothing! Get off my back, woman! (WHOOPING) Daddy, I haven't seen him like this since Halloween of '99.
Oh, I remember.
I clocked him at 58 miles an hour in his roller-skates.
In a Yoda costume.
So, how's it going with Romeo? Well, you know, I finally got Oliver to take it seriously and guess what? He's seriously horrible.
I just think you guys need to take a break.
We'll go to the Laker game, you'll sing the anthem, get your mind off of it.
I wish.
But all I can think about is getting a bad grade and looking stupid, - just because I'm stuck with Oliver.
- Mile, Oliver is I know, he's a friend and you don't bail on friends.
- Yeah, Mile, but - But nothing.
It's like he's the Titanic, and I gotta jump ship before I go down with him.
Mile, iceberg right behind you.
You said you'd be there for me.
- Oliver, I was just - Bailing on me? No, I was just thinking about bailing on you.
- It's different! - You said I was the Titanic.
Not the ship! The very successful movie! You made like $ 1 billion! Okay, Daddy, we need a new warning signal.
Honey, I did everything but baste you with barbeque sauce.
I should not feel bad about this.
It's not my fault that Shakespeare makes him nervous.
"What light through yonder window breaks?" How tough is that? ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the singing of our National Anthem by teen pop sensation, Hannah Montana.
(CROWD CHEERING) (SINGING) O say, can you see by the dawn's early light through yonder window breaks Or ramparts No, rockets.
(SPECTATORS BOOING) Red glare Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, that's right.
Look! I'm a cup fly! You get it? (BUZZING) Jackson, you want some pancakes with that syrup? No thanks.
I'm good.
Jumping Jehoshaphat, Son! Next time, don't waste a plate.
- Just drink it from the bottle.
- That's a great idea! Jackson! Whoo! That really worked.
Thanks, Dad! - Sweet.
- It's good.
Hey, Mr.
Stewart, how's Miley? Well, it's noon and she's still holed up in her room, if that tells you anything.
Hey, bud.
How you doing? Okay.
Except I had this awful dream where I forgot the National Anthem in front of thousands of people.
(CHUCKLES) That wasn't a dream.
You couldn't play along for like a minute? Oh, sorry, let's not think about it anymore.
Let's watch some TV.
Get your mind off of it.
WOMAN: Everyone is talking about Hannah Montana's massive mistake.
(SINGING) Through yonder window breaks (MAN SPEAKING SPANISH) I am so sorry you had to see that, Bearie.
Bearie the bear? - You couldn't do better than that? - I was three! And I'm not changing his name now, that would just confuse him.
- Here you go, Mile.
- I'm too upset to eat.
I'm not.
Well, listen, after tonight, when Hannah performs on Top Rockers, nobody's even gonna remember she screwed up the National Anthem.
- What? - Top Rockers.
I love that show! Made the call this morning.
It's all set.
Daddy, I can't perform on Top Rockers, that's a live show.
What if I mess up again? Miley, what's going on? You've never had stage fright before.
These are very good.
What did you do to them? I mean, I have never had people laughing at me before.
Mile, that's not gonna happen again.
Actually, I just put in just a splash of vanilla and a hint of cinnamon.
Daddy! Mile, listen, if you wanna put this thing behind you, you gotta get back on the horse, just like Uncle Earl.
Uncle Earl forgot the words to the National Anthem? No, Uncle Earl fell off a horse.
Took four of us to get that fat, old coot back up there.
I just don't wanna get laughed at again.
Wow.
And that's exactly how Oliver feels.
And you bailed on him.
Ironic, isn't it? Just stop your flapping and eat your flapjacks.
Mile, everybody gets nervous.
But the longer you wait, the tougher it's gonna get.
I guess you're right.
I just gotta do this, don't I? But what if I forget the words to one of my songs? Or I forget to put my costume on? Then I'd be singing in my underwear.
That'd be quite a show.
(BUZZING) Stupid selfish bees! How much honey do you need? Come on, Oliver.
Miley really needs us there tonight.
You can't just bail on her.
- Oh, you mean like she did to me? - But she knows how you feel now.
Leonardo DiCaprio threw a foam finger at her.
Hasn't she suffered enough? Let me think.
No.
Oliver! Oh, here we are in Happy Bunnyland, Tokyo.
(MIMICKING FOOTSTEPS) Oh, no, what's that? (MIMICKING FOOTSTEPS) It's Jack-zilla! Run for your bunny lives! (ROARING) What are you looking at? Jackson, you have to stop.
You're hopping down a bunny trail of no return.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Of course I do.
I was like you once.
But I'm a veggie man now.
I even worked out this morning.
It's like I have the energy of a 5-year-old again.
Great.
Tell it to someone who cares.
When you're ready to get that candy monkey off your back, call me.
Well, I don't need any help, all right? I'm perfectly fine.
Here you go, sweetie.
Here's your Oh, dear! Oh, don't pick that up, honey, it's filthy.
We'll get another one.
What's happening to me? Hey, Jackson.
Beautiful day for a walk, isn't it? (EXCLAIMS) Ladies.
With some pretty ladies to go on a walk with.
Hey, guys, wait up, I'll come with you.
See, girls? That's what too much sugar will do to you.
(GRUNTING) Guys, wait up! They make these chairs smaller? You're a speedy little guy, aren't you? Come on, guys.
(GRUNTING) Help me.
Help me, help me.
(SHUDDERS) I can see my feet again.
My skinny, skinny, little feet.
That's it.
That is it! You don't own me anymore, old devil sugar! (MOUTHING) I love you.
No! No! Now, bud, you've done this a million times.
You got nothing to be nervous about.
Then why am I sweating through my wig? You're gonna do fine.
I got all the confidence in the world in you.
Okay, just remember, if her mouth is open and nothing's coming out, you cut to commercial.
No worries, honey.
And I mean pronto.
Lola, I can't remember anything.
What am I gonna do? Don't worry, I got your back.
Oh, cue cards.
Great idea.
- What if I forget how to read? - Get a grip.
This is the life, hold on tight.
This is the dream, it's all you need.
Hey, you're right.
You know, that's great advice.
What advice? Those are the lyrics to your song.
Of course they are! I'm not nervous.
I'm good.
- Places, Miss Montana.
- Help me! I will.
Just remember, keep your eyes on me.
Right.
What song is that from? That's not a song, that was the advice! Oh, boy.
Oh, great, what's Oliver doing here? - Maybe he came to support a friend.
- Or maybe he came to laugh at me.
Could be.
Either way, good luck.
Four, three, two HOST: And now, live and acoustic, Top Rockers is proud to present! Give it up for Hannah Montana! (GUITARS TRUMMING) (SINGING) Take the world, shake and stir And that's what I got going on I throw my cares up in the air And I don't think they're coming down Yeah, I love how it feels right now Still loving how it feels right now Down in front!

I say, I say that I know I can Who said, who said I can't be President? I say, I say you ain't seen nothing yet Who said? Thank you, all.
You know, I had a rough patch at the beginning of the show and an even rougher patch earlier this week.
But I learned something that I should've known all along.
Good friends don't bail on you.
And they're always there to catch you if you fall.
We love you, Hannah! - I love you, too! I love you all! Thank you everybody.
Good night.
I love you, Jackson.
That's right.
I'm talking to you, big boy.
You're not real.
Can I have a bite of that, big boy? (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) I don't think I can do this.
Come on, Oliver, you just gotta stay positive.
Okay.
- I'm positive I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.
You were there for me and I'm gonna be there for you.
(EXCLAIMING) I love the energy I've seen today, I love the passion.
But most of all I love that we're almost done.
Stewart, Oken, take us home, please.
Okay, remember, all you have to do is die.
Go.
Oh, Romeo.
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
Oh, Romeo.
And now I die.
(GASPING) (BELL RINGING) I see the light.
Again, longer than it took him to write the play.

This is so cool! I can't believe how many people e-mail Hannah Montana.
"Dear Hannah, you rock.
Jill in Milwaukee.
" (BOTH EXCLAIM) "Dear Hannah, you're awesome! Danny in Iowa City.
" "Dear Hannah, get your bra off the shower rod.
Jackson in Malibu.
" (EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) And I mean it! He touched it.
Now I have to burn it.
"Dear Hannah, I love, love, love that scarf you wore at the video awards.
"Where, where, where can I get one? Jenny in Walla Walla, Washington.
" Listen to this one.
"Dear Hannah, I have this massive crush "on a boy who doesn't know I exist.
" - Typical.
- Yep.
"His locker is three down from mine.
What should I do? "Your biggest fan, Becca from Malibu.
" Becca from Malibu? You don't think it could be Becca Weller from homeroom? I'm thinking it's a good shot.
Let's see, three down from Becca (SIGHING) - Oliver? - Oliver? I can't believe it, Becca Weller is crushing on Oliver.
(CHUCKLING) "Dear Becca, if he won't ask you out, you ask him.
"Rock his world! Sincerely, Hannah Montana.
" Making the world a better place for love.
Hey, Miles.
My robe fell in the toilet so I borrowed yours.
Hope you don't mind.
Great, now I have to burn that, too.
(SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Did you see that? She just totally checked him out.
Definitely interested.
- Perfume walk-by.
- First you see her, then you smell her! Kinda like my Uncle Earl.
(CLEARS THROAT) Oliver? Hi.
Did you get the History assignment? I forgot to write it down.
No, I don't have it, but Mr.
Aaron, he always writes it on the board.
You can just go look at it.
Oh.
Okay.
I'll go look.
Thanks.
Oh, Oliver? Excuse us.
I'm sorry.
- What's wrong with you? - What'd I do? Couldn't you tell that Becca Weller was hitting on you? What? Ow.
A grilled cheese sandwich would've picked that one up! They're serving grilled cheese today? Becca's an A student.
She knows what the History assignment is.
Then why'd she ask me? And don't hit me again.
Because she's crushing on you.
Listen to me, and I'm going to make this real simple.
She like you.
How do you know? Remember when you had to spit-swear never to reveal my other identity? Yes, and I got a cold right after that, thank you very much.
Well, start sucking down some chicken soup, because Another secret's coming your way.
I wish we hadn't outgrown the pinky swear.
Becca e-mailed Hannah Montana and said she had a massive crush on you.
Becca Weller has a crush on me? Me? I know.
We were shocked, too.
So, Becca Weller wants to take a ride on the Ollie Trolley.
(CHUCKLING) All right then, let's go make her dreams come true.
Ding.
Ding.
A- ding, a-ding, ding! - I forgot something.
- What? - My name! - It rhymes with "trolley.
" I need more than that! That boy doesn't have the brains the good Lord gave a hunk of turkey jerky.
I don't get it, man.
What happened to Oliver Smokin' Oken? Yeah, you're usually all, "Hey, babe, "are you from Tennessee? Because you're the only 10 I see.
" I got one.
"Are you from Mississippi? 'Cause you're the only miss I sippy.
" What? You got something better? I just totally froze.
Has this ever happened to you? - Has this ever happened to him? - Excuse me.
But I can be honest about my romantic history.
I don't have anything to hide.
It's never happened to me.
(PANTING) Gimme a water, Son.
I swear there's nothing better than a 10-mile run down the beach.
One of these days I'm gonna know what that feels like.
Here you go, Dad.
Feel free to tip.
Here's one for ya.
"Stop leaving your underwear on the kitchen floor.
" Hey, bud, Miley told me about Ollie's Trolley's little derailment.
Well, why don't we just put it in the newspaper? Hey, it's nothing to be embarrassed about.
You wanna know how I got my first date? I walked right up to her, I looked her straight in the eyes and said, "My Robbie name is hi.
" - And it worked? - Like a charm.
I mean, sometimes with women, you just got to keep in mind it's not a matter of what you say, but having the guts to say something.
You just be yourself, partner.
(TINKLY MUSIC PLAYING) Well, if you all will excuse me, I think I've jogged my way to a fudgy-buddy.
Hey, ice cream man! (CHUCKLING) I got another one.
"Are you from Waikiki? "'Cause I gotta ask, why, Kiki?" Oh, come on, it works if her name is Kiki.
- Hello, Jackson.
- Hello, Rico.
- I want chicken wings.
- We don't have chicken wings.
- Well, we should.
- Well, we don't.
Come on, Rico, why do you always have to be so mean? Hey, everybody has to have a hobby.
I used to collect stamps, but this is more fun! Anyways, back to chicken wings.
Whose name is on that sign? - Yours.
- That's one.
And whose father owns this place? - Yours.
- (WHISPERING) That's two.
And whose father told you to "keep Rico happy"? Does this look happy? That's three.
And we have a winner! All right, Rico, what kind of wings you want? Mild, medium or spicy? I'd say medium, but then I couldn't say spicy! Just one more tweak and it's Becca time.
There, just messy enough to say, "I'm wild, but I can be tamed.
" Breath check.
(MOANING) (COUGHING) - That's perfume! - (CHUCKLING) Oops! Sorry.
- But it worked.
- This is it.
It's all up to you now.
- Are you ready? - I'm ready! - Do you feel it? - I feel it! - Are you the man? - I'm the man! (BOTH GRUNTING) Go, go, go! Hi, Oliver.
(CLEARS THROAT) My Robbie name is hi.
(CHUCKLING) My Oliver name is hi.
- Are you trying to ask me out? - Yes.
Wow.
For a second there I thought I was a babbling fool.
- Oh, baby! - Yes! What, a girl can't get excited about Brussels sprouts? What is the matter with you people? - Are you done? - Almost.
Now I am.
Keep your pants clean.
I'm gonna eat some ribs later.
Sad, sad, sad.
My best friend has been reduced to a moist towelette.
These are perfect.
Crunchy, spicy and ( JACKSON EXCLAIMS IN PAIN) Slippery.
Hot sauce in my eye.
Hot sauce in my eye.
(RICO LAUGHING) Soda in my eye! Soda in my eye! There's nothing like dinner and a show.
I told Dad this wing thing would work.
I can't wait to tell him my next idea.
Oh, man, it doesn't involve him in a chicken suit, does it? It does now! (SINGING) Everybody dance, everybody sing Everybody try a chicken wing - Free chicken wing! Hey! Back off! Watch the nuggets! (TSKING) Lying down on the job.
Dad's not gonna be happy about this.
Oliver, how did your date go with Becca? Yeah, come on! Flap those lips! Sorry, I don't kiss and tell.
- You kissed? - Tell! My lips are sealed.
She thinks I'm funny, smart and sensitive! It was the greatest afternoon of my life! Zipped tight.
This is wicked awesome.
Once again, Hannah Montana has made the world a better place for love.
Becca must be so jazzed.
I wonder if she's thanked Hannah yet.
- Check your e-mail.
- I am way ahead of you.
"Dear Hannah, thanks for the awesome advice.
"Too bad I have to end things with this guy who really likes me.
" (GASPING) What? "He's a super nice guy but I just have to tell him I just want to be friends.
" She's going to dump Oliver! After just one day? Well, think on the bright side, it is the longest relationship he's ever had.
I don't understand.
Becca was so into Oliver.
He thought things went great.
Why would she want to break up with him? - I think I know.
- The little tramp.
- (CHUCKLING) Hey, what's up? - Hey! - Oliver! - Oliver! You don't want to go in there.
Big casserole explosion.
Horrible.
- Tuna everywhere.
- What are you doing? - You need to dump Becca.
- What? Did you miss everything I said to my locker? Trust us.
She's bad news.
Real bad news.
Like walking barefoot through a field of cows after their morning sit down.
What? Y'all never heard that one before? Oh, I get it.
You guys are afraid I'll be too busy with Becca.
Come here! I'll always have time for my two little girls.
- But not right now.
Gotta go.
- Oliver, she e-mailed Hannah.
She said she just wants to be friends with you.
I'm sorry.
It's true.
She's already got someone else.
Oh, man! I don't understand.
We're supposed to go to the beach this afternoon.
Man, she's going to dump me at the beach.
No, you don't know that.
She could dump you on the bus, in between classes, in the mall.
- She could even text message you.
- That's what I'd do.
Why did you tell me she liked me in the first place? This is all your fault, you and Hannah's stupid e-mail advice! Why don't you stick to singing and your little dance moves? But - He's right.
I feel horrible.
- Don't.
You dance way better than that.
Hey, Mile, you're just in time.
I'm working on a new melody for Hannah.
Sit down and tell me what you think.
(SINGING) The other side, the other side The other side, you'll see The other side, the other side The other side of me (GROANING) Well, Jackson said he liked it.
Then again, he is a little kiss-up.
Dad, it's not the song.
It's just that I used the Hannah advice column to help Oliver get a girl and ended up making things worse.
Then I guess it's all your fault.
Whoa, you're not supposed to say that.
You're supposed to say I did it with good intentions and shouldn't be so hard on myself.
Okay, then you shouldn't be so hard on yourself.
How can you say that? It doesn't matter what my intentions were.
I meddled, and now Oliver's miserable.
You cannot just let me off the hook for that.
- Okay, you're grounded.
- No! This is where you're supposed to hug me and say, "Everything's gonna be all right, bud.
" - Do I have to draw you a map? - It sure would help.
Mile, you tried something, it didn't work out.
Sometimes that's just how life is.
It's like telling your brother to put on a new roll when the toilet paper runs out.
Sometimes he does it, sometimes I'm left sitting there reading shampoo bottles till someone comes home.
That don't mean I was wrong for trying.
- Everything's gonna be all right, bud.
- Too little, too late, Dad.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Have you seen Oliver? - Oh, yeah.
- Does he still hate me? - Oh, no.
He's way past that.
I hate my life, I hate my life, I hate my life.
Enough, already! Have some pride.
I keep telling you dump her before she dumps you.
Lilly's right.
The important thing is you're still Smokin' Oken.
(RAPPING) You leave the ladies heartbroken And everybody knows that we're not just joking - A wicky, wicky, why - And a wicky, wicky, bye You guys are right! When it rhymes, it makes sense.
(RAPPING) You made my life a wreck-a so I'm dumping you, Becca - You made my life a wreck-a - So he's dumping you, Becca A wicky, wicky, why A wicky, wicky, wicky What the heck are you wearing? Don't drain the tub.
I'm making soup.
What are you doing? I'm giving that Becca a piece of Hannah Montana's mind.
No, you're not.
Hannah Montana's done enough trouble for one day.
Oh, look.
How convenient.
She wrote you again.
Lilly, I mean it.
I'm not doing this anymore.
Uh-oh.
- What? - "Dear Hannah, you were right.
- "Oliver is such a great guy for me.
" - "So today in the cafeteria, "I broke up with my old boyfriend Toby.
" Toby? That's the guy she was holding hands with.
(SIGHING) "He took it pretty hard.
But now Oliver and I can be together.
" Not if he breaks up with her! We have to stop him! What are we standing here for? Let's go! I thought you weren't going to butt in anymore.
That was before we told him to break up with the first girl to like him since preschool.
Hey, I didn't "like him" like him.
I only held his hand because I wanted his crayons.
He had the 64 pack, with the sharpener! I'm not hanging from a parasail and flying across this beach.
Oh, yes, you are.
It's advertising, and my dad already paid for it.
I don't care.
- I refuse to look ridiculous.
- Said the man in the chicken suit.
Jackson, have you seen Oliver? Yeah, he's down on the beach with some girl.
'Cause he can get a girl, because he's not in a chicken suit! All I'm looking for is "down the beach.
" But thanks for sharing.
- We'll never get to him in time.
- I have to! I'm the one that messed this up.
If I don't stop him, - then I'm never gonna forgive myself.
- But how? Look how far away he is.
You'd have to be able to fly! Is that a parasail? Slow down there, toots.
There's only one way you get to go up in this thing.
You are one evil little boy.
It's a little too late for flattery.
Hit it! (SCREAMING) Hey, this isn't bad! (CHUCKLING) Oh, yeah, I like this.
Oliver! Oliver! Boat driver, I need to be lower! Lower! Lower! (SCREAMING) Thank you.
Becca, I Oliver! Don't do it! Don't say anything! Miley? Please say I'm not too late.
Miley, why are you dressed like a chicken? Because they're all out of gorilla suits.
Now, can we move on? Me and Oliver need to have a little talk, you know, face to beak.
Please say you didn't break up with her.
What? Excuse me, can't a chicken get a little privacy here? You were going to break up with me? Well, you were going to break up with me.
No, I wasn't.
Why would you think that? Because that's what you wrote Hannah Montana! - How did you know that? - How did I know that? How did I know that? How did I know that? Because you read minds.
Seriously, I don't read minds, that's ridiculous.
I read your PDA, which I stole from your gym locker.
- Why would you do that? - Because I'm a bad chicken.
And because she's in love with me.
- What? - Yes.
You don't have to hide it anymore.
Face it, you were nearly driven mad by the thought of me in the arms of another woman! Okay.
What he said, but with less feeling.
She's been in love with me for years.
- A deep, needy - Okay, she gets it.
The good thing is that nobody was breaking up with anybody.
Oliver's a really special guy.
You two were meant for each other.
Well, all that's left to say is, bock, bock, bye-bye! All out of eggs, sorry.
(IMITATING CHICKEN) Jackson! Jackson! Is that you? Jackson! - Yeah, Dad? - Jackson! Guess where I am.
Oh, no! Sorry, Dad, that's my bad, buddy.

Darling, are you done packing yet? We gotta get to the airport.
Uh, almost got it.
- Daddy, got any room in your suitcase? - No.
- But what about that - No.
- But what about the - No.
Excuse me, Miss Montana, there's a girl out here who wants to see you.
Claims she's Maddie from the candy counter.
You want me to tell her you're not here? But she's right there.
I can see her.
Not if her bodyguard says you can't.
Sorry, Hannah, can't see you.
(WHISPERING) By the way, love the top.
Hey, Roxy, she's a friend of mine.
She can come in.
You're in luck.
She's here.
Hey, I got my eyes on you.
Hey, Maddie, just the tush I've been looking for.
Can you close my suitcase? Wait till I tell my friends that I sat on Hannah Montana's suitcase.
(EXCLAIMS) You're not heavy enough.
Here.
Hold these phone books.
(SIGHS) I just wanted to say goodbye and thanks for the tickets.
Your concert was awesome.
Thanks.
Now bounce up and down.
Well, we are a full-service hotel.
(SINGING) I want my mullet back My old Camaro and my eight-track Wow, that guy sounds just like the singer my mom used to listen to.
Oh, what did they call him? You know, the "Honky-Tonk Heartthrob.
" Oh, you're talking about Robbie Ray? Yeah, yeah, that's the guy.
He had a couple of top 10 songs.
Actually, three number ones, two top fives, Music Video of the Year.
But who's counting? Oh, my gosh, you're Robbie Ray.
My mom thought you were dead.
She's gonna be so excited you're alive! I'm kind of happy about that myself.
Yeah, what about we take some of the happy and put it over here? I'm on the case.
So, why aren't you still performing? Oh, no, this old dog stopped howling a long time ago.
Howling Dogs.
That was my mom's favorite album.
- Don't you miss singing? - Maybe a little.
Wow.
It must've taken something huge to make you walk away from a career like that.
Yeah, it did.
These days, my life's all about managing Hannah Montana.
That's just the way I like it.
Well, darling, we got a plane to catch.
Let's get ready to head for the airport.
Man, I couldn't live with myself if I knew I was the person holding Robbie Ray back from howling again.
Wow.
Well, it was nice meeting you.
Hope you enjoyed your stay at the Tipton Hotel.
Holding him back? (DOOR CLOSING) Well, not for long.
(GRUNTS) (YELLING) (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) I can't believe this is your dad.
It's lucky records were so big.
There's no way you'd fit all that hair on a CD.
It's called a mullet.
"Business in the front, a party in the back.
" Oh, yeah! Before your dad was a dad, he was cool.
Before my dad was a dad, he was an accountant.
"Addition in front, subtraction in the back.
" - That's not the same, is it? - No.
You should've seen the look on his face when that girl in Boston recognized him.
I don't care what he says.
I know he misses being on stage.
(GASPS) He even had his own doll! DOLL: Yeah, doggies.
You guys.
You guys, you gotta check this out.
Look.
It's labeled "Robbie Palooza.
" Cool, Dad had his own palooza.
My dad had his own calculator.
Yeah.
(ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYING) Look how much fun he's having.
I can't believe it.
You've got a great voice, he's awesome.
What's your talent? Oh, uh, well, I don't like to brag, but, uh (CLEARING THROAT) (FARTING) (GIRLS EXCLAIMING) And when I'm clammy, I can do it behind my knees.
(FARTING) Ew! Slow down, Son, gonna give yourself another rash.
Whoa, Robbie Palooza.
What are you watching this old thing for? Mr.
Stewart, you were incredible.
What happened? I mean, why aren't you still performing? That was a long time ago.
These days, I got my hands full watching over Miley and Sir Toots-A-Lot.
Come on, Dad, we're practically adults.
I mean, if you wanna go back out and howl with the dogs, there's nothing holding you back.
Sweetheart, that was 10 years ago.
I bet my old manager doesn't even remember my name.
(DOORBELL RINGING) Robbie Ray, open this door! Well, is that your old manager, Marty Klein? I believe it is.
What a weird coinkidink.
You guys are smooth.
Where is my Honky-Tonk Heartthrob? There he is.
Look at you.
You look exactly the same.
No, you look better.
I hate you.
I love you.
Give me a hug.
Madman Marty, the one man party.
- I've missed you, old buddy.
- Stop it, you'll make me cry.
And look, there's handsome young Jackson.
And pretty little Miley, who I have not spoken to or had contact with in any way whatsoever.
Especially on the phone.
- It's okay, Marty.
He knows I called you.
- Good, 'cause I'm a terrible liar.
Hi, sweetheart.
Blondes are big this year.
If you got any talent, call me.
So, Marty, got anything interesting to tell my father? Don't rush me, kid.
I'm building to the big finish.
Okay.
So, I called The Roadhouse in San Diego.
You say the word and all next week, you, Robbie Ray, are the special guest star.
Ladies and gentlemen, Marty Klein! Whoa, let's just slow down a minute.
You walked away at the top because you wanted to be with your babies.
Well, take a look.
They're not babies anymore.
I believe Mr.
Klein is correct, Father.
Oh, come on, Dad, you know you wanna be on stage again.
- Here's your chance.
- Think about it, handsome.
You, the lights, the stage, the screaming crowd.
Robbie, Robbie, Robbie Okay, okay, okay.
I appreciate what you all are trying to do, but You'll think about it.
Fantastic.
That's all I wanted to hear.
And now, I'm leaving before I hear anything else.
Goodbye, good luck.
Ladies and gentlemen, Marty Klein! So, you've thought about it, you'll do it, you'll love me for thinking of it.
Ladies and gentlemen, Miley Stewart! Come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
Even if I was considering singing again, I'd get up on that stage and I wouldn't even know what to say.
Oh, I do.
DOLL: Y'all ready to howl with the dog? (HOWLING) (SINGING) I want my mullet back My old Camaro and my eight-track Fuzzy dice hanging loose and proud ZZ Top, they're playing loud You are the meanest man I have ever met! Why? To keep a talent so incredibly awesome as this away from a world that needs you so desperately.
It's just so selfish.
I can't even look at you.
Okay, darling, let's say I was thinking about singing again.
I can't take you guys with me and I sure can't leave you home alone for a week.
And you won't have to.
I did a little research, made a few phone calls, and I think I came up with the perfect solution.
May I present, direct from the International House of Nannies, the lovely and responsible Inga.
(SPEAKING IN SWEDISH) Nice try, Jackson, but there's no way I can leave this young lady here alone to nanny you.
You know, I thought you might say that.
Which is why I hired three nannies.
(SPEAKING IN SWEDISH) Now, I don't know about you, but I feel very, very, very nannied.
Ladies, I appreciate you taking the time to come over here, but this just isn't gonna work out.
(SPEAKING IN SWEDISH) Robbie Ray was huge in Sweden.
Robbie Ray? (IN SWEDISH ACCENT) Honky-Tonk Heartthrob? Ja, ja.
One thing.
You only had one thing to get.
Yeah, and I got three.
Forgive me for being an overachiever.
(IMITATING SWEDISH ACCENT) So, ladies, who wants to go boogie boarding with the son of the Honky-Tonk Heartthrob? You betcha.
By golly.
Ja, ja.
Yeah, come on.
Come on, Daddy.
I know you really wanna do this.
Miley, why you pushing so hard? Because I know the way I feel when I'm on stage.
I mean, don't you remember that feeling? Don't you want it again? - Of course I do, but - But nothing.
"But" is just a word you use when you're afraid to try.
That's something I learned from my daddy.
Oh, so now you listen to me.
And you should, too.
Okay, if you wanna know the truth, I did make some calls, but I just couldn't find anybody I trust to watch you kids.
So you're saying if you could find someone, you'd go? Sure.
It would be fun, but it's just not in the cards.
Well, shuffle them again, Daddy, and say hello to my backup plan.
Don't worry, hot stuff.
Roxy will take care of everything.
You just go get your mullet back.
Okay, kids, I'll see you at the end of the week when you come down for the last show.
Wish me luck.
- Hey, knock them dead, Dad.
- You're gonna do great.
What a beautiful scene.
A man and his children sharing a heartfelt goodbye.
You know what it reminds me of? The fact that my car is running and gas is $3 a gallon! Let's move! "Ladies and gentlemen, Marty Klein!" - Good luck, Dad.
- Bye, Daddy, love you.
Do you believe it? Dad's actually gonna go out and perform again.
I just wish we didn't have to wait a whole week to see him.
Yeah, I'm in agony.
And I'm over it.
Oh, Cooper's throwing a party.
Don't wait up.
Oh, can you drop me off at Lilly's? Slow your roll, children.
Your daddy left me in charge.
And that means, until he gets home, you're not leaving my sight.
I got my eyes on you.
What exactly does she mean by that? Good night, kids.
Good night, Roxy.
(SNORING) My eyes may be closed, but my brain is on red alert.
(SNORING) Hi-ya! (REVEILLE PLAYING) What is going on? - What time is it? - 6:00 a.
m.
It's time for our morning jog.
Jog? Mmm-hmm.
Now, let's get on those running shoes and move, move, move! You're in Roxy's army now.
(TRUMPETING) Hurry up.
Last one down has to stretch out my hamstrings.
I still can't believe your dad was up on stage last night.
So, how did it go? Did he call? Jackson? (SNORING) Boy, you're really out.
Don't even think about it.
Roxy was like this all night.
(SNORING) Hi-ya! (SNORING) Hi-ya! - Couldn't you just tell her to lighten up? - (WHISPERING) Oh, sure.
I tell her to lighten up, she gets upset, she leaves, Dad has to come home early, and once again, I've ruined his dream.
Why are we whispering? Because Roxy's everywhere.
Because she's got her eyes on me.
Okay, now you're just paranoid.
I don't see her anywhere.
Oh, yeah? Here.
Hit me with this magazine.
What? Just do it.
Trust me, I'll be fine.
Okay.
(ROXY SHOUTING) (SCREAMING) Roxy's like a puma.
I can't do this anymore.
It's only five more days.
Just do it for Dad.
Okay.
- And shift.
(BOTH GRUNTING) Roxy, I didn't think that the Marines did yoga.
Oh, I didn't learn this in the Corps.
Mmm-mmm.
I learned it when I was touring India with world famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma.
He calls me his "Yo-Yo Mama.
" - This hurts.
Oh, it's supposed to.
Feel that negative energy leaving your body.
Get out all that frustration and anger.
Yeah.
- Mmm.
Now, doesn't that feel good? Uh-huh.
Yeah, in about an hour you'll be able to do this.
(CRUNCHING) Ooh, I need a pedicure.
(DOORBELL RINGING) Uh, I'll get it.
Yeah, you better.
It's gonna take me a little while to get out of this.
(EXCLAIMS) Hey, Jackson.
Going to the movies.
Thought you might wanna - Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
- Now where do you think you're going? To the movies with my friends.
Please? Okay, okay, I get it.
It's Saturday, you wanna have a good time.
I'm not gonna stop you.
- Really? - Really.
Just let me get my purse.
Miley, come on, we're going to the movies.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
No way.
Uh, Roxy, I'm not really up for a movie.
And besides, I wanna learn that The foot thing you just did.
You know, I've always wanted to bite my own toenails.
Mmm-mmm.
I promised your dad I'd watch both of you, and both of you is who I'm gonna watch.
- But, I - Listen, I just need an aisle seat, okay? Roxy loves the big drink, but the big drink don't love Roxy.
Oh, you know what? We just remembered we got to (STUTTERING) Because, you know Bye.
But wait I can't believe you just did that.
- I cannot believe - You're angry, aren't you? - Yeah.
- That yoga didn't work for you, did it? No.
That's because you need some acupuncture.
I'll go get my needles.
That's it.
Five days? I can't take five more minutes of this.
- Jackson, where are you going? - San Diego.
I want my daddy back Jackson.
(GRUNTS) Jackson, you don't think that I miss him, too? The way he sings to us in the morning when he's making us pancakes, how happy he is when we come home from school.
No one's called me "Bud" in 48 hours.
Well, that's why I'm going to get him.
But, Jackson, it's not about what we want.
It's about what he wants.
Jackson! (GRUNTS) Turn around, girl, we gotta stop that boy.
- But, Roxy, how did you - Look, I just don't have my eyes on you.
I got my ears on you, too.
Let's move.
It's a long drive.
(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING) (CROWD CHEERING) (SINGING) I want my mullet back My old Camaro and my eight-track Fuzzy dice hanging loose and proud ZZ Top, they're playing loud A simpler time, that's what I miss Your mini-skirt and your sweet kiss Things have changed, man that's a fact I want my mullet back - Have you said anything to him yet? - No, I just got here.
Oh, he's really good.
Are you kidding? He's great.
Quiet.
Robbie Ray's got his groove on.
Howl, doggy! Howl! I want my mullet back My old Camaro and my eight-track Let's go, let the man rest.
Go, go, go.
Now.
Hey, guys, what are you doing here? Everything all right? Well, the, uh, truth is Jackson.
We just couldn't wait to hear you play.
You were so great, Dad.
I'm proud of you.
Thanks, baby, but you know I would've never have got back up there if it wasn't for you.
Guess what I just heard? Toby Keith has a new opening act.
You know who it is? Don't guess, I'll tell you.
It's you.
- Me? - Six beautiful weeks.
One of which is in, yes, Hawaii.
Ladies and gentlemen, Marty Klein! Six weeks? - Wow, that's - Awesome.
So incredibly awesome.
Really.
They're gonna love you in Hawaii.
Excuse me, Jackson.
Miley, wait up.
You kids sure must love your dad if you're willing to do six weeks of Roxy Time.
Six weeks? Hey, Bud.
You all right? - I'm sorry.
- For what? For crying? Hey, if you don't want me to go, just say so.
Daddy, you gave up your whole life so I could have my dream.
How can I stop you from having yours? You kids are my dream.
I didn't give up my career 'cause I had to.
I gave it up 'cause I wanted to.
But I saw you up here tonight.
You did so good and you looked so happy.
I was.
But I was a lot happier when I saw you kids coming through the door.
So, does that mean you don't want to do the tour anymore? Six weeks away from you kids? I think I'd miss you too much.
We'd miss you, too.
Well, maybe you can just do the Hawaii part and take us.
Mom, quick, get the curlers out of your hair! Robbie Ray is still here! (SCREAMING) Too close, candy girl.
(SCREAMING) (CRASHING) (SINGING) I want my mullet back My old Camaro and my eight-track Fuzzy dice hanging loose and proud ZZ Top, they're playing loud (FARTING) A simpler time, that's what I miss (FARTING) Your mini-skirt and your sweet kiss (FARTING) Things have changed, man and that's a fact (FARTING) I want my mullet back I want my mullet back

Stop, stop.
(MUSIC STOPS) Hannah, darling, we're doing an ad for skin cream, not wart removal! - What is that face? - I believe it's a reaction to your singing.
- And you are? - Hannah's manager.
Well, "Hannah's manager," I'm an award-winning photographer, so why don't you just push your tush off my set? And I'm also her father.
Oh, I need a chair for Mr.
Montana's tush! Ah, there you go.
Comfy? - Like a monkey in a banana bath.
- How charming! (LAUGHING) Okay.
Hannah, darling, Magic Glow Skin Cream, everyone's favorite zit-zapper, is using this billboard to launch a worldwide campaign, okay? So give me jubilance peppered with rapture and sprinkled with just a dash of je ne sais quoi.
No, no, no, that's not even close.
How about, "Say cheese?" - I need some cheese for Mr.
Montana! - Nice spread, Son.
You need to slow it down a little bit.
What I'm saying is if you just keep it simple, you'll get more out of her.
Yes, Mr.
Montana, anything you say.
(CHUCKLING) Just what I need, Jethro's chicken fried wisdom.
Ah! All right, Hannah, say, "Cheese!" Oh, okay.
All right.
Good.
Okay.
Yes! Good.
You're getting there.
Yes.
Oh, fabulous.
Oh, yes, fabulous! Perfection! Perfection! I've done it again! (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar?

For the winning shot - Come on, Lilly, flagrant foul! - Oops.
My bad.
Here you go.
Nice hands, Shaq.
- Why don't you have your contacts in? - My dog ate them, along with an entire tube of toothpaste.
He's been doing this all morning.
Lilly, how are you gonna get a sneak peek at my Magic Glow billboard tonight if you can't even see? I'll just imagine your head really big with pigeons on it.
I know, you're giving me a look, I just can't see it.
- Don't you have backup glasses? - Oh, you mean these? Wowee! Look at those styling specs! Nice try.
Never let your mother buy you glasses at a place that also sells tires.
- Hey, Truscott! - Yeah! Who's that? Heather.
Okay.
Give them attitude.
More 'tude! Congrats on making the half pipe finals.
- I'm so sorry.
- About what? Sorry I'm gonna beat you.
Again.
- Beat you again! - You've got no chance.
No chance! - Shut up! - Shut up! Oh.
Let me tell you something, Heather.
No.
Let me.
Hold up, slick, no one talks to my girl like that.
- Ow.
- Sorry.
Saturday night in the finals, you're going down! You may have beaten Lilly last year, and the year before that, and the year before that (MUFFLED SPEECH) I think she gets it.
You're the one who's gonna get it bad.
(ENUNCIATING) Get it bad! - Too much? - You think? You know what? You may be the champion now, but after Saturday, you're gonna be the chumpion! High five.
(THUDDING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Just answer your phone before you hurt anybody else.
Hello.
Hey, Mom.
What? But they said Okay, fine.
My contacts aren't coming till next week.
Oh, so what? You can just wear your glasses to the skate finals.
Who cares? I do.
No way I'm gonna compete if I have to wear these.
Are you kidding me? All you've been talking about is double kickflipping Heather all across the skate park.
That was with two eyes, not four.
Over here.
I am not going in front of all those people looking like this.
Lilly, will you please forget about how you look? It's what's on the inside that counts.
Easy for you to say.
You're the poster child for perfect skin! This isn't about me.
Or my perfect skin.
Oliver! Please tell Lilly that looks don't matter.
Okay.
Looks don't matter.
See? If Oliver can say it with his freaky nostril thing, - you can get over your glasses.
- Yeah.
What? Oh, you know, how one is way bigger than the other? You don't see him obsessing about it.
Oh, my gosh.
Look at me! Look! I am a lopsided freak! I'm sorry, I thought you knew.
Stop staring at me! I'm not an animal! Jackson.
There's something wrong with that boy.
Why? Why? Why me, Dad? Why me? I was just asking myself that same question not five seconds ago when I unloaded these.
Whoa, it worked! They are whiter.
And lemon fresh! On the bright side, I'm just glad to see you're wearing clean underwear again.
- So, how'd the date go, Son? - I still can't believe it.
I finally got Melissa to go out with me, we're cruising down the coast highway, and I do that yawn thing, where I get my arm all the way around her.
And then (IMITATES ENGINE SPLUTTERING) I can see where that would have been embarrassing.
But at least you were in a convertible.
Dad, it wasn't me, it was the car! I didn't have enough money so I ran out of gas.
- It was humiliating.
- Don't sweat it, Son.
I'm sure your friend understood.
It's not like you made her get out and push.
This has been the worst date of my entire life! Well, maybe a little kiss will make it better? Somebody had to steer.
- Hello, Jackson.
- Hello, Rico.
So, your boss, the man I call "Daddy," tells me you asked him for a raise.
Yeah, I did.
Girls like cars, cars like gas, and gas costs money.
What's it to you? Well, Daddy still hasn't made up his mind.
Could go either way.
If only you had someone, someone Someone on the inside.
Someone who knows how to pull on his heartstrings and make him dance like a little puppet.
What do you want, Rico? (CHUCKLES EVILLY) And now, the Great Ricolini will perform the legendary disappearing egg trick, with the help of my charming assistant, the lovely Tina.
She should have shaved her legs.
But isn't she wonderful? Here, O Great Ricolini, the magical egg.
(CLICKS) Please, no flash photography.
Isn't she wonderful? I hold in my hand what looks to be an ordinary egg.
But is it? One, two, and Yes, it is.
And I thank you.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Lilly, there's no one up here.
This is really getting stupid.
We passed stupid on the third floor.
Now we're up to sports hernia.
Okay, fine.
- Whoa! This is so cool! - Wait till you see the billboard.
Not before the drum roll.
(CLATTERING) What? You know, they really don't look that bad.
If it helps, I think they're pretty cool.
- Aw, man! - What'd I say? Dad, when a parent says something's cool, you know it's dorky.
Okay, I get it.
Lilly, I think those glasses are a big bowl of ugly.
(CRANKILY) Thanks a lot! "Big bowl of ugly"? Work with me here.
Oh, well, enough chitchat.
How 'bout we unveil this masterpiece? Yeah.
And, Lilly, when you beat Heather in the skate finals, no one's gonna be looking at your glasses.
They're gonna be looking at the big trophy in your hand.
Well It is big, isn't it? Oh, yeah.
And if it were me, I wouldn't let glasses or anything stop me from going after what I really wanted.
Really? Well, what if you had a zit the size of a tomato? Lilly, come on.
Now you're just being ridiculous.
Oh, yeah? Turn around.
(GASPING) Daddy! Who put my face on that zit? - No, ma'am.
No way.
- No, ma'am.
No way! We never agreed to something like this.
No, we did not! I know, but I had an inspiration.
If Hannah Montana says, "Even I get zits," she should have a zit.
It was staring me right in the face.
Yeah, well, now it's staring all of Los Angeles right in the face.
- And we don't like it.
- No, we do not! I hear your concerns.
There's nothing more important to me right now than your feelings.
Be right back.
(SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION) I need more emotion! You're strong, you're fearless! You're a superhero saving the world.
Give me something.
I can't work with this! Not so easy when it's your face that has the problem.
I don't have a problem.
Why should I have a problem? After all, looks don't matter.
And if that's the way they want to go with this worldwide campaign, I'm fine with it.
Sorry, Mile, but this is the way they wanna go with the worldwide campaign.
What? I mean, really? Great.
Awesome.
Terrific.
I love it! You do? Yes, I do.
I mean, after all, looks don't matter.
I don't just talk the talk, I walk the walk.
You are amazing.
I mean, if you can stand up in front of the whole world with that ginormous zit, something any normal person would be humiliated by Lilly.
Please.
Get to the point.
The point is that, if you can do all that, then I can wear my glasses to the skate competition.
Thank you so much.
This is the greatest thing you've ever done for me.
I am gonna double kickflip Heather all over that skate park! Thanks to you.
I'm so proud of you, Mile.
Thanks.
(DOOR CLOSES) Daddy, we have got to get rid of that zit! What happened to, "Looks don't matter"? What happened to, "Don't worry, I'll fix it"? I tried, bud.
(MIMICKING) "I tried, bud.
" Hey, Dad.
Well, you move the family to Hollywood, and this is what you get.
Come on, Jackson, we gotta do this quick.
Sorry, I need my cash up front.
I've got one kid yanking my chain already.
- I don't need another one.
- Fine.
Half now and half when the job's done.
Done.
Okay.
Let's cover this goober.
Wait.
I got a better idea.
It's not ready yet.
Just hold the paint.
Hey, Miles, what are you gonna tell Lilly at the big unveiling when she sees that the zit's gone? Not a problem.
She'll be at the skateboard competition.
By the time she sees the billboard, she'll have her trophy and I'll have my face back, just like that.
Nice work.
- Thanks.
You know, sometimes the voice in my head sounds just like Dad.
There's a reason for that.
Oh, man.
Busted.
So who's the mastermind behind this operation? Okay - Jackson made me do it.
- What? Dad, why do you have a paint brush? - Jackson made me do it.
- And I repeat, what? Mile, you know I'll always be there for you.
You're my little girl.
Wait, what am I? Tina.
My other little girl.
So, Rico, check this out.
Your little magic act inspired me.
Keep your eye on the ball.
Round and round they go.
Watch the amazing works of the magnificent Jacksolini.
- Where's the ball? - Nice try, amateur.
You call that a trick? No, I call that a setup.
Here's the trick.
Oh, gross, man.
This stuff stinks.
Hey, hey! Hey, do you want this? Fetch.
Go get it, boy.
Your dad called me this morning.
I got the raise.
And thank you.
This isn't over.
I got the raise, and dumped it on you.
I dumped it on him.
- I dumped it on you.
- Jackson? Melissa! Great news! I'm a man with money and a lotta gas.
In my car.
What did you do to this little boy? First of all, he's not a little boy.
(SOBBING) I want my mommy! Stop that! No, you stop it.
Make him stop, nice lady.
And to think I came all the way over here to give you a second chance.
But He's the devil.
And you're pathetic.
Come on, sweetie, I'll take you home and wash you off.
Wait.
I have money.
Who wants to talk to me? Hello? Hi Oh, you're not important enough.
Oh, look, it's the Montana posse.
Howdy.
Nice 'stache.
You grow them fast down south.
Once again, I'm sorry about What was I sorry about? Putting that zit on my child's forehead.
(FAKING LAUGHTER) Okay.
Right, well Who else wants to talk to me? Psst! Psst! Psst! She's with me.
Lilly, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be at the skateboard competition.
I'm going straight from here.
But what kind of friend would I be if I didn't come to support you after all you did for me? That's so sweet.
Thank you so much.
- Now go.
- No, no, no.
When they pull that cover off and expose that big zit, I'm going to be right here for you.
Again.
I appreciate it, now leave.
No way, I'm staying.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to present my latest masterpiece, the worldwide premiere of the Magic Glow Skin Cream campaign! (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) Hey, what happened to the zit? Where'd it go? Wow! That zit-zapper really works! Where's my zit? I loved that zit! That'll teach you to sell us a horse and then deliver a mule.
- You covered it up.
- Lilly, you don't understand.
Oh, I understand fine.
You lied to me.
But, Lilly! Just because I couldn't take my own advice, doesn't mean you shouldn't.
I mean, go to that skateboard competition.
Teach me a lesson.
Be my role model.
Save it.
Why should I believe anything you tell me? Because you said it was the best thing I ever did for you.
Well, sometimes I say things I don't mean.
You should know what that's like.
Lilly, please, give me one minute.
Well, here she is, the new Magic Glow Skin Girl, Miss Can't Even Have One Little Blemish, no matter how many awards I'd win if she did.
Ladies and gentlemen, Hannah Montana.
Thank you.
It's a real honor to be the spokesperson for Magic Glow Skin Cleanser.
But if there's one thing I've learned throughout this entire experience, it's that nobody's perfect, even celebrities.
You look pretty perfect up there.
Yeah, but sometimes I look like this.
Whoa.
I didn't want people seeing me this way, but I was wrong.
Looks aren't everything.
I'm not gonna say that they don't matter, but there's stuff that matters more.
And if you let a zit, or let, say, dorky glasses stop you from living your life, you're gonna regret it.
You really will.
So, take your pictures! Let the world see that even Hannah Montana gets zits, and I'm okay with it.
(CROW CAWING) But this, I ain't so crazy about.
You know, for a cowboy, you're kind of cute.
- Just walk away, sister.
- Okay.
(WHISTLING) Well, I'll be danged.
The boy was right.
That pots and pans cycle really does get my clothes whiter.
I told you.
And as soon as my stuff is done, the dryer's all yours.

I can't believe we're gonna have an actual TV star in our homeroom.
Come on, Lilly, give the guy some space.
I'm sure the whole reason he's coming to school here in the first place is so he can be treated like a normal kid.
But he's not a normal kid.
He's Jake Ryan! The dreamy zombie slayer on Zombie High.
(IMITATING GHOST) I never miss that show! This is so awesome.
I'm going to be this close to a famous person.
(LILLY EXCLAIMING) What am I, a grilled cheese sandwich? When you're Miley, you might as well be.
- He's coming! He's coming! - He's coming! He's coming! Guys, guys, just calm down.
Even though Jake's a big TV star, here he's just another student who totally destroys zombies! Dude, you rock! Hey, thanks, man, but if it's okay, I'd like to say something to the class before we start.
Of course.
- This is so cool! - I know! Now look, I know my coming here may be a distraction since I am, well, you know, a superstar, and T'ween magazine's Hottie of the Year.
- (GASPS) I framed the cover! - Me, too.
- I hung it in my bathroom! - Me, too.
Oh, my gosh, we have so much in common! We both love you! Excuse me, superstar, Hottie of the Year, your point? My point is, is that even though I am all of those things, I want each and every one of you to think of me as someone just like you.
(SNORTS) Really? Well, try, okay? - Say your line, just once, please! Yeah, say it.
Say it! Oh, come on! Say it! Dude, I slayed you once.
Don't make me slay you again.
(ALL APPLAUDING) I can't believe how cool he is! I can't believe how cool he thinks he is.
Hi, I'm This Week In Hollywood's Bree Yang Shixian Takahashi Samuels.
We're doing a story on Jake Ryan's return to a normal life.
Do you mind if we get a few shots? (CHUCKLES) Not at all.
How's my hair? Doesn't matter.
Now, we want everything to look totally normal.
So I'll need makeup on Jake and some prettier-looking people around him.
Tell me again why you don't want people to know - you're Hannah Montana.
- Because they'd treat me like that.
Oh, yeah, it's much nicer over here with Dandruff Danny.
(COUGHING) (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Excuse me.
Coming through.
Jake! Jake! Actual student, trying to learn.
This is ridiculous.
He's a TV star.
Big whoop! (SINGSONG) I'm starting to think somebody's jealous.
No, I'm not.
(SINGSONG) And stop singing.
I don't care that everyone's falling all over him.
I care that he's milking it.
He's not milking it.
You're the one who said he only came here so he could be a normal kid.
And that's when I said, "No, Mr.
President, you rock.
" Oh, yeah.
You can really tell he hates all this attention.
Let's get some shots down there, Jake.
All right.
Hey, s'up? (SIGHS) Whoa! (ALL CHEERING) He asked me, "S'up?" - Miley? A little help here! (WHIRRING) Hey, Jackson, this paint job is sweet.
Hey, can I try that? Sure, just, uh, make sure you get a good grip.
- That thing's got a little bit of a - Oh! kick.
(CAR HORN HONKING) Wow! Dad, for me? You shouldn't have! I didn't.
My lease was up and I figured, "What the heck?" So, what do you think? I think it makes Jackson's car look like a piece of pie.
Yummy, yummy pie.
- Not so fast, slick.
- I just want to sit in it.
Let me make this simple.
I don't want you touching this car.
I don't want you breathing on this car.
I don't want you looking at this car for more than ten seconds without express written consent of major league baseball.
Dude, he so owns you.
(WHIRRING) Whoa! Uh, excuse me, Mr.
Vernon? Something wrong with my locker? No, no.
I just thought Jakey needed more room.
What? And that's when I said, "No, Mr.
Trump.
You're fired!" Hey, do you think one of you guys can save me a seat in the cafeteria? - I'll do it! - I can! Thank you.
- Oh, Tony! - Jakey! I just asked if you could get the squeak out of the door.
This is above and beyond.
Give me some love.
- You da man.
- No, you da man.
- Oh, no, you da man.
- No, you da man.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, great.
Who da man that knows where my locker is? - Oh, wow.
Was this your - Yes, it's my locker.
- Don't sweat it, Milly.
- Miley.
Like it matters.
Here's your stuff.
Come with me.
You're down by the boiler room.
Locker one.
- What's this? - Cheese.
While you're down there, reset the traps.
(IMITATES MOUSE GNAWING) (IMITATES TRAP CLOSING) Now while you're taking the test, I expect complete silence.
(RUMBLING) What was that? I had a Hannah thing last night, and I overslept and missed breakfast.
(RUMBLING) (SHUSHING) Okay, normally I'd be polite and ignore that, but ow! If that's the thunder, I don't want to be around for the (IMITATES BELCHING) lightning.
Trust me.
Been there, smelled that, don't want to go back.
Stewart, you know the rules.
Oh, I hope you have enough there for everybody.
Only if they take really, really small bites.
I'm the only one that gets to do sarcasm around here.
Give it.
Thank you.
You guys got to stop sneaking food into class.
I'm already wearing my fat jeans.
- (GASPING) Hi, Jake.
- I was gonna say that! S'up, Jake? S'up? - Lilly, you dropped something.
- What? Your dignity.
Sorry I'm late, Mr.
Corelli.
I had a premiere to go to last night and overslept.
Oh, and let me tell you, Natalie Portman, Britney Spears and Jake Gyllenhaal, name-droppers.
Tell me about it.
Keep smiling, and go.
Thanks, Pat.
Sorry, I didn't have time for breakfast.
Can't have that.
It's the most important meal of the day.
Enjoy.
But I didn't and he gets to (RUMBLING) Okay, I've heard enough out of you.
Ladies and gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen Start your pencils.
On your marks.
Get set.
Test! (MUFFLED) Hey, Miley, can I borrow a pencil? I don't have one, and stop talking.
You're gonna get us both in trouble.
Oh.
Here, I have one, take mine.
Thanks.
(SIGHS) Real smart.
Now, how are you going to finish your test? Oh, right.
Do you have a pencil? - Weren't you listening? I don't - CORELLl: Ladies! What's with the chitty-chatty bang-bang? - Jake started it.
- She's right.
It's my fault.
Jake, no, please.
No need to be heroic.
You do enough of that on the TV.
If he were really heroic, he would've brought a pencil! None of us knows how hard it is to be a celebrity.
Well, I do.
I mean, I do imagine.
You know what I do imagine? You and your back talk and your gurgling intestines in the principal's office.
Stop.
I can't let this happen.
Leave the girl.
I'm the one you want.
If you've got the guts.
I did that in the season three finale.
Nominated for an Emmy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- No.
Stop.
But this isn't about me.
Here, Miley, take this.
It might help.
An autographed picture of you? Yeah, the principal's been riding me for one.
Maybe it'll soften him up.
Look at him.
He never stops giving! "Don't let the zombies get you down.
"Your favorite zombie slayer, " Jake fatheaded Ryan!" Ooh, looks like somebody's not happy with their new celebrity classmate.
You're darn right! Ever since he's gotten here, he's just been obnoxious.
He gets everything he wants just because he's famous.
Well, he's not the only star at this school and I think it's about time that she starts getting some of the perks.
Another star? Really? Who? Me.
I'm Hannah Montana.
Yeah, and I'm J-Lo Mein.
No, really, I am Hannah Montana! Come to this address after school and I'll prove it to you.
Are you out of your Hannah head? You can't tell Bree Yang Shixian Takahashi Samuels this! It's like Clark Kent ripping off his clothes and showing everyone his blue tights at the Daily Planet Christmas party! I mean, why should I keep it a secret? If I told, then I wouldn't have a locker in the basement, I wouldn't get sent to the principal's office and I could eat breakfast in class until I puke.
(GRUFFLY) Which Tony the janitor would happily clean up! Hey, Miley.
It's me, Jake.
I'm in disguise.
As what, an egomaniac TV star in a hat? (LAUGHING) You're lucky.
If my ego wasn't so big, that would've hurt.
(MOUTHING) Look, I was wondering if I could talk to you for a minute.
Sure.
Sorry, Lilly, I meant Miley.
No problem.
He knows my name! Let me guess.
You need me to move 'cause I'm in your favorite tan spot, right? Actually, I was just coming over to apologize for everything.
I'm really not a bad guy, and I hope I get the chance to show you that.
Why do you care what I think? Well, to be honest, you're the only one at school who hasn't been falling all over me, and I kind of like that.
- Plus, you're cute.
- Really? You think I'm cute? Not that I care.
Dude, you're Jake Ryan! Yeah, I guess my disguise didn't work.
- Wow, shocker.
- Come on, do the line! Do the line! - I would, but I'm kind of - Do the line! (WEARILY) Dude, I slayed you once.
Don't make me slay you again.
Yeah, you're better on TV.
Miley, wait up.
Look, I'm sorry, it's just Well, most of the time this whole star thing is cool, but sometimes I wish I could turn it off.
- You know, just be a normal kid.
- Really? You do? Oh, my gosh! (BOTH SCREAM) It's Jake Ryan! Jake.
I love you! I guess I'll see you at school.
(CLAMORING) You know, after you talk to that reporter, it's going to be like that when people spot Miley.
Okay, guys, it's a bathroom.
I kind of need to do this alone.
- Are you sure you're ready for that? - No.
Lilly, I think talking to that reporter was the biggest mistake of my life.
On the upside, he thinks I'm cute.
Not that I care.
(ENGINE FALTERING) - Start! - Sounds like a dead battery, son.
It can't be.
I have to pick up Jennifer for the Coldplay concert.
Turn over, you piece of junk! No, no, no.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that, baby.
Son, you can apologize all you want, but without a new battery, you'd have an easier time turning over Uncle Earl in his waterbed.
Hey, Dad, do you think maybe I could Oh, no! Come on, you were sixteen once.
Don't you remember? I sure do, which kicks that "no" up to a "heck, no"! Please? I promise to be a perfect gentleman.
I'll bring her back on time.
I won't make her go any faster than the legal limit.
Do you give that same speech to Jennifer's father? No, but do you think that'd work? It ain't working on me.
Please, Dad.
I mean, have a heart.
Okay, son, here you go.
(LAUGHS) Come on, Dad.
You said I could go.
(ROBBIE GRUNTS) It was harder than I thought.
Oh, I almost forgot.
My sculpting spray.
You never know when you're gonna wanna lock it in.
Ooh.
Funny story.
I took my son's car in to get a new battery and (SIGHS) Well, long story short, it needs a new door.
Three days? It only took the garbage truck two seconds to rip it off.
(CAR APPROACHING) Gotta go! (WHISTLING) So, son, what you doing home so soon? Coldplay catch a cold? Get it? Coldplay? - Come on, let's go in the house.
- (STAMMERING) No, wait, Dad.
I have to tell you something about the car.
Oh, your car's fine.
Got a new battery for it.
My gift to you.
Now, come on, let's go on in the house and we'll wrestle like we used to.
It's not my car.
Yours.
- Something happened.
- What? When I was going to pick up Jennifer, very carefully, her dad brought out the Rottweiler to make sure that the dog had my scent.
And one of the spikes on his collar kind of Well, look for yourself.
Dang flabbit! Jackson Rod Stewart! This is just a part of life.
The important thing is no one was hurt.
Wait, that's it? That's all you're going to say? It wasn't your fault.
Sometimes things happen and it's nobody's fault.
So let's go on in the house and I'll bake some brownies - and let you lick the spoon.
- Ooh.
Wrestling and brownies? Who died? You mean a father can't even bake for his son and put him in a half nelson - without something being wrong? - You're right.
I'm acting like you, being all suspicious of me.
Oh, just let me put away my sculpting spray.
No! (EXCLAIMS) My door! Where's my door? Okay, I know it looks bad, but it wasn't my fault.
So, you want nuts with those brownies and some of the little sprinkly things? Dang flabbit! Robbie Ray Stewart! It was a secret.
A really good secret that kept my whole life perfect.
And now it's just gone because I wanted pancakes in class.
I just wish you had thought of that before you invited that reporter over.
Me, too! I made a mistake.
I'm a teenager.
We act without thinking and we get zits.
It's what we do.
So, any idea how you're gonna get yourself out of this one? Daddy, that's your job.
You're a dad.
That's what you do.
How are you gonna help me if you can't even keep up? Well, we don't have long until the reporter gets here, but I do have a little bit of an idea.
(BELL DINGS) Let me just get these brownies out to Jackson before his masseuse gets here.
- What masseuse? - Don't ask.
Hi.
I'm This Week In Hollywood's Bree Yang Shixian Takahashi Samuels.
I'm looking for Hannah Montana.
Sweet niblets, that girl's done it again.
Done what? My daughter has a little bit of an overactive imagination.
She likes to pretend she's celebrities.
Last week, she was the Olsen twins.
Both of them.
You talk about a Full House.
Whoo! Anyhow, sorry if she caused you any trouble.
Not so fast.
I've been doing a little research, and the buzz is that Hannah Montana lives somewhere in this neighborhood.
Well, not in this house.
Be sure to grab yourself a sprig of that rosemary out of the garden on the way out.
It's delicious on fish.
- Bye-bye now.
It's okay, Daddy.
We don't need to pretend anymore.
I think it's time that the world knew the truth.
I'm Hannah Montana.
I'm ready for my close-up! Really? The closer I get, the more you look like a bad Hannah impersonator.
Oh, yeah? Could a Hannah impersonator do this? (SINGING OFF-KEY) This is the life, hold on tight Oh, yeah! And this is the dream, it's all I need Oh, yeah, you never know where you La-la-la-la Oh, yeah! My name's not really Miley Oh, yeah! I'm Hannah Montana, believe me Ooh! (PLAYING DISTORTED TUNE) Wow.
I know.
So where should we do the interview? On the couch? Oh, uh Who's at the door? Is it my extra cheesy pizza? Get out of here, Elvis.
I'm trying to do an interview.
My brother thinks he's Elvis.
(MIMICKING ELVIS) Hey, there, pretty mama.
You wanna interview the King? (LAUGHS) Actually, I think I've got everything I need.
Thank you, Hannah.
Elvis.
I haven't officially introduced myself.
I'm Billy Ray Cyrus! Okay, that's it, we're out of here! Go, go, go.
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT) Y'all come back now, ya hear? It looks like you lucked out this time, bud.
But be careful.
Next time you ring that Hannah bell, you might not be able to unring it.
Don't worry, Daddy, if I ever really do decide to tell the world I'm Hannah, I'll be extra sure it's what I want to do.
Yeah, well, if you do decide to do that, me and your brother's gonna be standing there with you.
Yep.
In the meantime, I'll be in the hot tub waiting for my daddy to bring me a chicken fried steak.
- There is no way - Car door.
Uh-huh.
It wasn't my fault! Let it go, Daddy.
Elvis has left the building.
Uh-huh.

Behind the ears.
Over the ears.
Ooh, I know.
One behind, one over.
Oh, yeah! (GROANS) Hey, it's not that bad.
(GROANS) Okay, all right, no ears.
Lilly, this isn't about your ears.
I'm trying to tell you something.
What, that your pants are on too tight? No.
Guess what famous pop star is playing Zaronda, Princess of the Undead, on Zombie High? - (GASPING) Paula Abdul? - No.
- Hannah Montana! - That is so cool! But, wait, you don't know how to act.
What are you talking about? I act every day.
I act like I'm not Hannah Montana.
I act like Oliver's jokes are funny.
Yesterday, I acted like I liked that sweater you wore.
What? Just kidding, I loved it! See? I was acting.
Or was I? Ooh, you are good.
Hey, do you have any scenes with Jake Ryan? I haven't gotten the script yet.
But I don't care.
I get enough of that egomaniac at school.
Oh, come on.
You so like Jake.
No, I don't.
How can you say that? Because every time his name comes up, you act like you can't stand him.
- That's not acting.
- Or is it? No! You're the only girl at school who doesn't have a crush on him.
Oh, please, I think people are starting to see through his phony little game.
Hey, ladies, please, no crowding.
Sally, Wendy, Yolanda, you know the rules, before noon only the names that start with "A" through "L".
Hey, have you guys heard? Sometime today Jake's gonna ask one lucky girl to the '70s dance.
As soon as he picks one, there will be 100 depressed girls looking for a shoulder to cry on.
Well, here it is, broad and water absorbent.
Look at him.
It's disgusting.
Come on, if he asks you to the dance, are you telling me you wouldn't say yes? Yes.
Yes, you'd say no or yes, you'd say yes? No! Yes, I'd say no! Hey, Miley, you wanna go to the '70s dance with me? (ALL GASP) - Yes.
Aw.
- I mean no.
Yay! - No? - Yes, I mean no.
Huh? - Now you cheer.
Yay! - No? - Yes.
- Yes! - No! Now stop that! (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Lilly, look what I got.
- Not now.
Jake's about to change.
- Into what? A decent human being? No, he's going to take off his rash guard.
But, Lilly, I just got the script for Zombie High! No way, let me see it! (GIRLS SIGHING) Oh, man! I missed his muscles.
His zombie-slaying muscles.
Lilly, build a bridge and get over it.
(GASPS) Look at the title.
It's called "Forbidden Love".
- I wonder if that's you! - It better not be.
- Hey.
What's up? - Nothing.
Just a magazine.
- What? - Nothing.
Hi.
Listen, about the dance.
You, uh, seemed really nervous when I asked you, which is to be expected, 'cause, you know, look at me.
I do.
All the time.
Even when you don't know I am.
Did I say that out loud? Yes.
I wanted to give you a second chance.
So, you want to go with me? Jake, I wasn't nervous then and I'm not nervous now.
I just don't wanna go to the dance with you.
Okay, so that's a no? - Yes.
- Yes? No.
Now stop that.
Okay.
I just want you to know that I'm shooting an episode with Hannah Montana this weekend, and even though I'll be kissing her, I'll be thinking of you.
- Oh, my God! Jake! I love you! - You are so amazing! Can you believe that guy? Trying to make me jealous by saying he's gonna be kissing Hannah Montana.
Wait a minute! - Oh, no.
- Oh, yes! This is horrible.
Not only do I have to kiss him, but my lips fall off.
No, it's okay.
See, he reattaches them with his love.
- Aw! - Ew.
- Hey, Dad.
What you got there? - Birthday present for Uncle Earl.
- Ooh, cool, can I see? - Son, don't open it.
Don't open that! (WHIRRING) Turn it off, turn it off! Three, two, one.
What is wrong with you? I'm sorry, Son.
I told you not to open it.
You know how your Uncle Earl always sends me a prank for my birthday? Well, this year I decided it was time for a little vacuum-packed payback.
Cool, can I get in on it? Oh, Son, no offense, but this game's for the big boys.
Your Uncle Earl's one of the all-time great pranksters.
- No.
- I think you should just stay out of it.
- I wouldn't want you to get hurt.
- Are you saying you don't think I have what it takes to put one over on Uncle Earl? (SCOFFS) Son, you couldn't even put one over on your old man.
Gee, Dad, I guess you're right.
We'll see you later.
- Jackson, I know that look.
- What look? Bye.
Something tells me this ain't gonna be pretty.
But it might be fun.
Hi, Hannah, I'm Roger, your director.
Big fan, big fan.
You look horrible.
It's fantastic! Listen, I've been thinking about the script - and I've just got one little problem.
- Oh, boy.
No, it's just a little thing.
See, do I really have to kiss that zombie slayer? Well, since the divine prophecy states that only by reawakening the cold, dead heart of the princess can the slayer rout the forces of darkness and save the world from ultimate destruction, I'm gonna have to say yes, you do.
But why does he always have to save the world? I mean, can't his faithful sidekick Demon Dog save it this week? I would rather plant one on the pooch.
Interesting idea.
I'll mention it to the writers.
But for right now, try to have fun.
And remember, all of us here, big fans, big fans.
(CHUCKLING) Looks like we've got another diva guest star.
Turn on the charm.
- She's a little nervous about the kiss.
- Aren't they all? I mean, look at me.
Yeah, you're beautiful.
Big fan, big fan.
Just do it.
Hi, Hannah, I'm Jake Ryan.
We're thrilled to have you on the show this week.
Yeah.
It's gonna be real interesting for me too.
So, what do you think of the script? Well, I love everything except page forty-one.
Oh, the kiss.
Yeah, nothing personal, buddy, but Man, this is not my week.
I mean, first, this girl I like won't go to the school dance with me and now my zombie princess won't kiss me.
Yeah, well, I just don't think that the zombie princess would Who's this girl at school? - Her name's Miley.
- Wow.
What an interesting name.
I've never heard anything like it.
She must be really unique.
She is.
She's cute and funny and smart.
She's so down-to-earth.
And when I talk to her, it doesn't feel like she's talking to Jake Ryan the celebrity, but she's talking to Jake Ryan the person.
- You know what I mean? - Yeah, I do.
Sometimes you need to know that people like you for who you are - and not just because you're a star.
- Exactly! And she doesn't like me as a star or a person.
Isn't that great? Is this a trick question? No, it's just It's something new to me.
(SIGHS) Look, I'm really sorry I'm dumping all this on you, it's just I can't stop thinking about her.
Really? Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to forget about it.
Oh, yeah, right, I suppose forgetting about her's good.
So, back to the kiss.
Don't worry about it, all right? Just close your eyes and count to sixty.
It'll be over before you know it.
- Sixty? Places! Hope you like thunder mint.
Darling, in three and a half miles, you are all mine.
Maybe just three.
What the heck.
How about I just jog down to the end of the driveway, get the mail and be right back.
(WHISTLING) Come to papa.
Booyah! (SCREAMS) Boy, I could use a glass of milk.
Your life is about to get real interesting, Son.
Zombie High bathroom.
Take one! Action! - You have betrayed us, Zaronda! - No! The slayer is lying to you! I saw the two of you with my own dead eyes! - Oh, you know what this means? - No, not the third stall! Not the portal to the underworld! No! Dudes! I slayed you once, looks like I'm gonna have to slay you again.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (ROARING) (FLUSHING) Flush twice, it's a long way down.
(COUGHS) Oh, Zaronda! Are you okay? For a dead girl, I've never felt so alive.
- Then why did you run away from me? - Don't you see? Our love is forbidden.
We can never be together.
Then maybe this will change your mind.
MILEY: He really is cute.
And he thinks I'm cute and down-to-earth.
Oh, stop it, Miley, you don't like him.
Oh, who am I kidding, yes, I do.
And that thunder mint Wow! Cut! That's lunch! What? Wait, wait, wait! What about the kiss? I thought about it and you're right.
We'll see how the audience feels about the relationship first, - then bring you back.
- But In the meantime, after lunch, we'll try that kiss with Demon Dog.
What? Hope you don't mind the taste of kibble and gravy.
He is a messy eater.
(GROWLS) Hey! Don't listen to me.
Aren't you the director? Be a man.
Wow, Hannah, you were really great in that scene.
You looked like you really wanted to kiss me.
(STAMMERING) Yeah, well, it's called acting! You better brush them good if you're gonna be kissing me.
Lilly, I've been calling you all morning! Why haven't you been answering your cell phone? My dad took it away after my last Biology quiz.
Who knew photosynthesis had nothing to do with photography? Everyone.
Now do you want to hear about Zombie High or not? Yes, yes, yes! Tell me everything! But start with the kiss! How was the kiss? - Wet and kibbly.
- Ew.
Yeah.
I ended up kissing Demon Dog.
(GROANS) (SHUDDERING) Anyhoo, that's not what I wanted to tell you.
It's about Jake.
- I realized that I actually - Hey, guys.
- Oh, Jake.
Hi.
- S'up? Okay, Jake, about the dance thing Don't worry, Miley.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
I've learned my lesson.
- Oh, really, because I realized that - That I should move on, I know.
I know.
That's why I came over here to ask Lilly.
Do you wanna go to the '70s dance with me? What? - Yes.
- Huh? Cool.
I'll call you with the deets.
(GASPS) I'm going to the dance with Jake I'm going to the dance with Jake Why aren't you happy dancing? Why aren't you happy dancing? - Because I like Jake.
- Since when? Since he saved me from going through the portal to the underworld.
Those kinds of things make you realize what's important in life.
But ever since the day he got here, all I've heard from you is, "Oh, he's so stuck-up," and, "Oh, who does he think he is?" - Yeah, well, I changed my mind.
- Yeah, right after he asked me.
No.
Actually, last night, which you would've known if you would've had your cell phone.
Photosynthesis! I mean, come on! - How is this my fault? - It's not.
Tell Jake that you can't go to the dance and everything will be fine.
But I don't want to tell him that.
But he likes me.
He only asked you 'cause I said no.
(STAMMERING) So, what are you saying? That I'm the canned fruit cup you get when they're all out of the chocolate pudding? - What? - You know what I mean.
Well, I've got news for you.
The Jake ship has sailed.
And you're not on it.
- I'm in a first-class cabin.
- Just leave mad already! Happily! - My house is this way! - My house is that way! (ALARM CLOCK RINGING) (GIRLS LAUGHING) Morning, Son.
You sure are a heavy sleeper.
Well, I'm gonna get you for this! (ALL LAUGHING) What the (WHISTLING) (CREAKING) (CRACKS) What's wrong, Dad? You look a little down.
Good job, Son.
Now.
Let me give you a little hug, okay? Oh, no.
You stay away from me, sticky man.
Oh, no, let me give you a little low-fat raspberry love.
Bye-bye.
Oh.
Before digital photography, that would've taken me a week to paint.
Gotta love the progress.
That was a good one, Dad.
That was a good one.
Now give me a hug.
Oh, no.
Get away from me, pudding boy.
- Come on.
- Get away from me.
Come here.
Give me a hug.
Daddy! (FUNK MUSIC PLAYING) That was The Miami Funk Corporation with The Groove is Gonna Getcha, Shoogie Oogie Oogie.
- I'm having a great time.
- Me, too.
Hey, you know, that reminds me.
There's something I've been wanting to do all night.
Really? Oh, boy.
(CHUCKLES SHEEPISHLY) Just stretching my lips.
I heard the punch is tart.
Hey, disco man, mind if I borrow your mike? Dude, are you kidding? Just let me do a quick intro.
All you superfly guys, and you foxy ladies, it gives me great pleasure to introduce a living legend, a star for the ages, the King of Funkytown.
Yo, Oliver, before the semester ends.
And my close personal friend, Jake Ryan.
Who says I'm the second coolest guy at school.
Thanks, everybody.
I just want to say how happy I am to be part of a school where everybody is so nice and alive.
(LAUGHING) (LAUGHING FORCEFULLY) - Dude.
- Sorry.
Anyway, I want to dedicate this song to all the friends I've made here and one very special friend.
Hey, y'all.
What's up? - Whoa.
Whoa.
What are you doing? You're supposed to be at a '70s dance, not turning letters on a game show.
Oh, my goodness, I completely forgot.
I hope I don't stand out.
I know exactly what you're doing.
You're trying to get Jake to notice you.
No, I'm not.
Oh.
Hi, Jake.
Hi, Miley.
You look great.
Really? I think she looks like a fire truck.
A very cute fire truck.
Hey, less talkie, more dancie.
Oliver! Let's get this party started now! (DISCO MUSIC PLAYING) Whoo! Looks like somebody's trying to bump up the party.
Everybody's doing the bump.
Girls, please put the claws away.
- Stay out of this, Jake! - Yeah, we're fighting over you.
- Knock it off, he's my date! - Yeah, well, he asked me first! You said no, three times! Forgive me for thinking that meant no.
Hey.
Well, you're forgiven.
- Chocolate pudding! - Fruit cup! Wait.
Celebrity in pain.
(ALL GASPING) (CRASHING) Congratulations.
You made me look ridiculous in front of Jake.
Oh, yeah? Look what you did to me.
I'm not the one trying to steal someone else's date.
- How could you do that to me? - I don't know.
I mean, it was Jake and he's just so cute.
(SIGHS) And that thunder mint.
Wow, and I kissed a dog.
I think I deserved it! Well, you can have him.
I don't like him that much, anyway.
- Since when? - Since Since I saw the way he looked at you.
- Lilly, I mean, I just - Forget it.
Easy come, easy go.
You go back out there.
I'll just rinse the sherbet out of my wig.
- You gonna be okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
(SNIFFLES) - Lilly.
- It's nothing.
I'm just rinsing my wig.
(SOBBING) With my tears.
Why aren't you leaving? Because I hurt my best friend over some guy.
And nobody, not even Jake Ryan, is worth that.
- I'm sorry, Lilly.
- You should be.
- Ew.
You smell really bad.
- You smell really bad, too.
- Hey, you two okay? - Yeah.
We're fine.
Yeah, we talked.
We worked it all out.
Sorry, Jake, I'm not into you anymore.
That's cool.
So, Miley, - you want to dance? - No, thanks.
I'm gonna dance with my best friend.
Whatever.
So who wants to do the Hustle with Jake Ryan? - I don't know what they see in him.
- Neither do I.
- Good thing we're over him.
- Oh, yeah.
(SIGHS) (SIGHS) (CHEERING ON TV) Hey, Jackson, get up and get me a soda, would you? (SARCASTICALLY) Yeah, sure.
I go open the refrigerator and a monkey pops out and hits me over the head with a banana.
- You want a drink, you go get it.
- Oh, no.
I see what you're doing.
Turn it around so I get up and open up the fridge and a monkey hits me in the face with a pie.
A- ha! So there is a monkey! (DOORBELL RINGS) - Oh, no, man.
I'm not getting it.
- Neither am I.
Let the monkey get it.
Well, maybe there's a ten million dollar winner at the next house.
Come on, guys.

We're gonna miss you, Principal Fisher.
I can't believe you're retiring.
You don't look a day over eighty.
Lilly, he's only sixty-five.
Really? Is he sick? He will be after he sees this.
Let's see what farewell words Dandruff Danny has for Principal Fisher.
One second, let me fix my hair.
This is gonna take a while.
Uh, I was just kidding about before, sir.
It's not that you're old, it's that you remind me of my dead grandfather.
But he didn't die from old age.
He got hit by a school bus.
Ironic, isn't it? Uh, Principal Fisher.
Now, Oken, I hope this is not some sort of video farewell for a beloved retiring principal.
(CHUCKLES) Hey.
All right, you girls, hold it right there! - I want to do mine over again.
- We'll clean it up in editing.
Miley.
Miley? Miley.
Move over girls.
Listen, Jake, and listen good.
There's only one dame in the world that's right for a guy like you and you're looking at her.
What took you so long, baby? Traffic.
Now plant one on me and make me remember why I waste my time with you.
Miley! Miley! What? You were dreaming about Jake again, weren't you? No, I wasn't.
Why would you say that? I'm so over him.
- Hey, Miley.
- I'm over you, okay? Move on with your life! I was just gonna tell her her shoe's untied.
Whoa! (CRASHING) (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you, but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) (SINGING OFF-KE Y) If we were a movie You'd be the right guy And I'd be the best friend That you'd fall in love with And I can't sing this anymore.
I mean, it's not like girls just stand around dreaming about boys all day.
You okay, darling? Of course, I'm fine.
It's just there's other more important things in life, like world peace, and Whales.
Why can't we do a song about whales? And not stupid boy whales.
Girl whales.
Happy, independent girl whales.
I'll get right on it, darling.
(SINGING) Girl whales, doing their nails Don't need no males Practically writes itself.
Daddy, I'm not saying that's exactly the song.
I'm open to other fish, too.
- Can I take a break? - I think that's a good idea.
Besides, there's somebody here who wants to see you.
Dad, I'm not in the mood to see anybody right now.
Well, fine.
If you don't wanna see me, I'll just turn the bus around - and head on back to Nashville.
- Aunt Dolly! Look at you.
My goodness.
You are sprouting like a rosebush after a month of rain, only not as wet and twice as pretty.
Whoa doggies, I like that.
I might use that in a song.
Well, fine.
First one's free, next one you share profits with me.
Come in here, sweet pea.
I got a story to tell you about this possum and a skunk that were sharing a pew at church.
Okay, what's his name? What are you talking about? I am talking about my goddaughter crushing over some boy harder than a monster truck driving over a little clown car.
Monster trucks, clown cars.
Oh, I've missed you, Aunt Dolly.
You're funny.
You know, we're thinking about getting a dog.
Really? Well, you might want to think about naming him Zippy, because zip is what I'm getting from you.
Listen, sweet pea, when you decide you want to talk about this boy that don't exist, you know I'm here for you.
And I'm here, too, bud.
Robbie Ray, you nosy hillbilly! Hey, I'm not listening.
I just wanted you to know I'm here.
And I'm not a nosy hillbilly.
I'm a concerned hillbilly father.
- Morning, Dolly.
- Hey.
Whoa! Looks like my home's been invaded by aliens from the Planet Froufrou.
Robbie Stewart, you keep making fun of my decorating, I'm gonna have to tell your kids how you used to run around in a diaper and little black boots saying, "Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.
" Come to think of it, I love what you've done with the place.
(CHUCKLES) Hey, good.
Would you just say that to the folks back home? And while you're at it, would you please tell Uncle Zeke to get rid of that awful mullet comb-over? Lord knows how that man can take one hair, wrap it completely around his head and down his back.
It's called a skullet, and it ain't that bad.
Well, you ain't seen him floss with it.
- Ready? - Hey, everybody.
Hey, Uncle Zeke.
You might want to treat yourself to a haircut, and get you a toothpick.
- I'm going for a jog.
- Okay.
Oh, man.
- This is not good.
- Oh, what's the matter with you? Aunt Dolly, I smell like a petunia.
What did you wash this stuff in? Well, just a little fabric softener and a whole lot of love.
You got anything to say to the folks back home? Well, sure.
Hey, everybody.
When the guys get a whiff of me, I'm gonna get beat up today! Bye.
(LAUGHING) Well, at least you got a look at him before that happens.
So, let's go check on Miley and see what she's up to.
Come on.
(SINGING) If we were a movie You'd be the right guy I'd be the best friend That you'd fall in love with In the end we'd be laughing Watching the sunset fade to black Show the names, play that happy song Well, that was just beautiful, sweet pea.
I can't wait to hear you sing it, when there really is a boy.
His name is Jake.
Jake Ryan.
(GASPS) The zombie slayer? (IMITATING JAKE) "Dude, I slayed you once.
Don't make me slay you again.
" That boy is too cute! I know.
He goes to my school.
And sometimes he can be really obnoxious, but then he gets really sweet and then he gets all obnoxious again.
That reminds me.
I gotta call my husband.
Aunt Dolly, puberty crisis here.
Darling, I am so sorry.
I just forget sometimes.
Being a teenage girl is harder than walking through a balloon shop with a porcupine purse.
I don't know what to do, Aunt Dolly.
Jake said he likes me 'cause I'm the only girl at school who's not falling all over him.
And if I tell him that I like him, then I am falling all over him.
I'm caught between a rock and a zombie slayer here.
Well, honey, nobody knows what's around the corner but I know one thing, if you keep yourself out of the game for fear of losing, there is no way on this Earth you're gonna win.
So you're saying that I should just walk up to Jake and say, " Jake Ryan, I'm through pretending that I don't like you, "when the truth is I'm totally in love with you.
" Wait a minute.
Is this thing on? Oh, good golly, Miss Dolly.
You know what? I am forever leaving this thing on.
Last Christmas, I got four hours of the dog chewing the head off the Little Drummer Boy.
Poor little old Rufus was chucking up body parts for a week.
(PHONE RINGING) Uh, Aunt Dolly, I think your hair's ringing.
Well, honey, when your pants are as tight as mine, you've got to have somewhere to put your phone.
Hey, sweetie, I was just talking about you.
(SHOUTS) Rufus ate what? No.
(WHISPERS) I'll be right back.
He did? The one out on the patio? Miles, I gotta get this video in today and you're the only one who hasn't said goodbye to Principal Fisher.
So take your time, think of something really good.
- And, action! - Okay.
Bye.
Perfect! Muffins! Bye.
Why didn't I do that? "A day over eighty.
" What was I thinking? (CAR HORN HONKING) Oh, that's my mom.
I have to get to school early so I can turn this thing in to the editor.
(IN DEEP VOICE) Oliver, let's go! (CAR HORN HONKING) I thought you said that was your mom.
It is.
When she's mad, she uses her man voice.
Move, move, move! Wait a minute.
I thought he took his camera.
Oh, that's Aunt Dolly's.
Funny.
It looks a lot like Oliver's.
Yeah, but Aunt Dolly's has her initials on it.
See? Where's the "D"? Where's the rhinestone "D"? Miley, it's just a camera.
What's the big deal? That camera has a tape of me saying, " Jake Ryan, I'm totally in love with you!" - Whoa! - I know.
- Hey, Jake.
- What's up? Quick, Oliver, you took the wrong camera.
Give it back.
- Sorry.
Here.
- Thanks.
- Where's the tape? - I gave it to the editor.
- Who's the editor? - Jake.
Jake who? Ow, ow, ow! Thanks a lot.
You ripped out my only chest hair.
So I gave Jake the tape.
Just go ask for it back.
I can't believe I have to do this.
Jake, can we have our tape back? Please.
I looked great.
She looked terrible.
- Better than you! - Keep dreaming! - Uh, Jake? - One second.
Guys, if I let you redo your tape, then everyone's gonna want to do the same thing.
I'm sorry, but nobody gets their tapes back under any circumstances.
So, uh, Miley, what's going on? I just wanted to tell you that I know another guy named Jake Ryan.
So if you ever hear me talking about Jake Ryan, I'm talking about the other Jake Ryan.
Not you, Jake.
Other Jake.
Bye-bye.
You're dead to me.
Dad, I don't know why, but I have this funny feeling that Aunt Dolly replaced my shampoo.
Whoa! Well, join the club, Son.
Looks like we've been volumised and Dolly-sized.
I can't take this anymore, Dad.
Between the shampoo and the smelly tissues, and the potpourri, and all these flowers, I mean, I'm losing my manly essence! There's only one thing we can do, Son.
Let's go to the gym and fight back with the one thing she can't take from us.
Our man stink! Uh, Dad, can we maybe do it tomorrow? Aunt Dolly buffed my nails and I don't want to ruin them.
Do you hear yourself, Son? Oh, no! Get me to the gym, fast! (BOTH EXCLAIMING) We've got to figure out something, Lilly.
Jake's probably laughing at that tape right now.
I know, this is awful! This is horrible! This is so cute! (GASPS) Can I borrow it? Put that away, Lilly, I've got something else for you girls to wear.
Thanks, Aunt Dolly, but clothes aren't going to help me now.
Oh, these will.
I got you girls into this mess, and I'm gonna get you out.
If that boy won't give the tape back, we're going in after it, undercover.
Ooh, I like the way she thinks.
- And I love the way she accessorizes.
- These boots are made for sneaking.
(LAUGHS) (SPY MUSIC PLAYING) Girls, I don't just rock, I roll.
Okay, let's just focus on the plan.
Aunt Dolly and I go into the edit room.
Lilly, you stand watch.
We get the tape and we're out of here.
Okay.
(RATTLING) (WHISPERS) It's locked! Not for long.
These nails ain't just for scratching.
Like a charm.
I haven't carried a house key in years.
Okay, people, let's get her done! (SHOES SQUEAKING) Lilly, less squeaky, more sneaky.
(WHISPERS) Sorry.
- Oh, no, he's in there.
What do we do? I'm sorry, honey.
Mind if I clean up in here? Well, it don't matter because I'm gonna clean up anyhow, so don't sass me, boy.
No problem.
Oh, one sec.
Since you're here, I might as well toss this.
Oh, wait! Don't you want to finish that? You're a growing boy.
Nah.
I eat too much of this junk anyway.
Uh, can't let you do that.
Union rules.
I'll take care of it.
I'll just toss it to the left of the trash can.
(BANGING) Whoa, what the heck is in there? Well, I guess that dead lab frog still has a little hop left in him.
Sweet niblets, you are Jake Ryan! - You are Jake, aren't you? - Yes.
You're as cute as they said.
Can I have your autograph? Sure.
It's really for my goddaughter.
I mean, she just loves you.
Really, she loves you.
(RUMBLING) That's that dang frog again.
Hey, what happened to all my tapes? Hey, didn't you say that very line in the famous lost zombie tape episode? Yeah.
Some of my finest work.
Well, I have heard about you.
I've heard you do some great stuff.
And you are as cute as they say.
Well, gotta go, while the getting's good.
Oh, uh, one more thing.
Shake in the hole! (WHISPERS) Did you get it? Oh, I got it.
I got it good.
- Strawberry.
- Oh, my favorite.
(INHALING) Breathe that in, Son.
That's the sweet stench of independence, freedom and manly pride.
I hear you, Daddy.
(EXCLAIMS) My eyes are burning, my eyes.
I'm so ranky, I taste my own stanky.
I can't stand it! I'm taking a shower.
And I'm using Aunt Dolly's peach body wash with exfoliating loofah glove.
(EXCLAIMS) Well, you loofah all you want to, I'm gonna take a bubble bath with one of her citrus fizzy balls.
Maybe two.
What are you so upset about? You got your tape back.
I know I should be happy, but I'm not.
I mean, it makes sense.
You're right back where you started, secretly crushing on Jake.
If I were you, I would've listened to your Aunt Dolly and just tell him how you feel.
Why didn't you tell me that yesterday? Because I wanted to wear the cool black outfit.
Okay, I'm just gonna do it.
I'm gonna tell him the truth.
You know, he might think I'm falling all over him, - but at least he'll know how I feel.
- And maybe he'll feel the same way.
- Yeah, you're right.
It's worth the risk.
- Yeah.
- I'll never know unless I try.
- Yeah.
(WHISPERS) Here I go.
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey, Miley.
- Listen, I have something to tell you - Hi, Jakey.
Hey, Rach.
Oh, Miley, you know Rachel, right? From Spanish class? Oh, sure.
Hi, Rachel.
Yeah, we're kind of going out now.
Isn't that great? Yeah.
Really great.
So, uh, what was it that you wanted to tell me? Nothing.
It's not important anymore.
All right.
Well, see you around.
Yeah, see you around.
He loves me not.
Still not loving me.
Too busy loving Rachel.
And he still ain't loving me, and now he's not loving me anymore, and now I need more petals.
You got any ideas what we're gonna do about this? Have you ever known me not to have an idea? Just follow my lead.
So, Robbie, do you remember when you were trying to get up the courage to ask Miley's mom out and she just turned you down flat? Yep.
She said she was already dating somebody else.
And do you remember what I told you? Yep.
You said, "Next time you're gonna ask a girl out, "don't wash your truck, wash your hair.
" I mean after that.
Yep.
You said, "The only way to not be in the game, "is to take yourself out of the game.
" Guys, I know what you all are trying to do, but let's face it, I waited too long.
I blew it.
Game over.
Robbie, is this the same girl that came to me and said, "I want to be a singer.
" And I said, "Sweet pea, the chances of that happening are one in a million.
" And she said, "I want to be that one.
" - Where's that girl? - She's right here.
Well, if you hadn't taken that risk, you never would've become Hannah Montana, now would you? No.
So So if I want something bad enough, I should get off my butt and fight for it.
That's right.
That reminds me of a song by my favorite teen pop star.
(SINGING) Who said, who said you can't be Superman? I say, I say that I know you can Who said, who said you can't be worldwide? I say, I say time is on your side Who said, who said Jake won't be the guy? I say, I say give it another try Who said, who said you can't be ten feet tall? I say, I say that I can have it all Who said? (WHOOPING) - Oh, I love it.
Who said? Have you been using my citrus fizzy balls? No, ma'am.
But I did use your apricot scrub.
(LAUGHING) You know, Aunt Dolly, I kind of modelled Hannah Montana's look after you.
Really? I thought I was missing a wig! Don't make me smile.
I'm cracking.
You know, this avocado mask tastes ten times better than the mango scrub.
You know, Rufus ate a whole bowl of that mango scrub once.
For a whole week, that little dog smelled like a tropical breeze coming and going.
Cool.
Can't wait.

(SINGING) Stand, for what you believe in Stand, for all that is right Stand, when it's dark all around you You can be that shining light Stand, when troubles come calling For what you believe in Your gonna be all right Stand, just reach deep inside you And be that shining light Stand Dad, that's awesome.
That is the best song you've ever written.
I can't wait to record it.
What's the bad news? Bad news? What are you talking about? It's a great song.
Thank you, Lilly.
You know, I've always liked her.
Don't change the subject.
Every time he has bad news he tries to soften it up with a great song.
Best of Both Worlds, I had to get braces.
This Is The Life, Jackson decided not to go to sleep away camp.
Pumpin' Up The Party, my goldfish died.
When my goldfish died, my mom flushed it down the toilet.
I'll never forget her comforting words.
"Get over it, Oliver, it's a stinking fish.
" That explains so much.
Come on, Dad, just tell me.
Trust me, I can handle it.
Your cousin Luann is coming to visit.
Who wants pie? Miley? - Miley? - What kind of pie? Come on, Mile.
Don't forget that wonderful, wonderful song that I just wrote you, that you love so much.
(SINGING) Stand, for what you believe in Stand When does her broomstick land? Come on now, Mile.
Now, let's don't start this again.
She's a good kid.
Let's not forget who pulled you out of that well when you were just six.
Let's not forget who pushed me in.
Hey, that was an accident.
Sometimes kids do stuff without thinking.
(BUZZING) Got it.
Stupid fly.
I didn't plan that, but there you go.
I can't believe this.
Halloween is two days away and you're making me share my bathroom with the Princess of Darkness? If Luann's coming, I'm sleeping over at Lilly's.
Oh, come on, Mile.
Now, listen, you guys have grown up.
She's grown, you've grown, you're a lot alike.
(DOORBELL RINGS) How can you say that? I am nothing like that horrible, ugly witch.
Howdy, cuz! (THUNDER RUMBLING) Well, doggies! This is one humdinger of a shack! (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Uncle Robbie, Daddy said that these were your favorite Halloween cookies.
I made them myself.
Pecan crunchies! Sweet nutty niblets.
Hey, you churned your own butter, didn't you? Is there any other way? - Whatever you do, don't eat that.
- Why not? Because it was made by the devil's little helper.
You are being ridiculous.
(CHOKES) (EXCLAIMS) - Lilly! - Oh, please.
Next you're gonna be saying, (WHISPERS) "She sees dead people.
" You know, it's amazing how much you and Miley look alike.
Always have.
When we were young'uns, you know, before she was Hannah Montana, she was in the Little Miss Tater pageant, but I had to take her place before the talent part 'cause she got all nervous and barfy.
I wasn't nervous, she slipped me some bad catfish.
She's always been jealous of me because I can sing and she can't.
What'd she do for the talent? (SQUEALING) Pig calls.
(SQUEALING) Man, I miss Tennessee.
Boy, she cooks, she calls pigs.
- Where have you been all my life? - Oh, you.
Mamma warned me about you handsome Californy fellers.
Oh, you, too.
Didn't you say you named your pet pig Luann? Yep.
(LAUGHING) (SNORTING) And now you know why.
Oh, this is pathetic.
Dad, every year we put up the same stupid decorations and all my friends laugh at us.
I don't know, I think these are pretty gruesome.
Look out, it's a spider! It's in your hair.
It's crawling in your ear.
It's on your shoulder.
Boo.
Pathetic.
Could we at least get something halfway decent this year? I mean, our Christmas decorations are scarier than this.
Hey, just because one of Santa's eyes fell out doesn't make him any less jolly.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) This stuff scares 6-year-olds.
It's not like we're gonna find something that scares us.
(EXCLAIMS IN FEAR) Stewart, someone shoved your magazines through my mail slot.
Hmm.
I'm guessing that would be the mailman.
What's with the Halloween decorations? Or should I say Hallo-weenie decorations? (LAUGHING) Your winking Santa was scarier than this.
(WARBLING) You know, I was hoping this year you'd be a little competition for me.
But I was wrong.
Dad, are you just gonna let him get away with that? Don't worry about it, Son, it's a holiday.
We're not gonna get sucked into his little game.
Said the loser! Don't go challenging me, Dontzig.
Oh! I'm shaking.
Well, take it outside.
I don't have earthquake insurance.
Save the jokes, Goldilocks.
You're gonna need a sense of humor when all the kids see how "unscary" your house is and they start pelting it with eggs, which would be an improvement over this paint job.
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (WARBLING) That's it, he's crossed the line.
He insulted my hair.
Get in the car, Son.
We're gonna put the "boo" in Malibu.
Yes! It's gonna be a hair-raising experience.
I don't know why you're making such a big deal about your cousin.
Luann seems really nice.
Yeah, and a Venus flytrap seems like a pretty plant until it throws you down a well.
Trust me, underneath those little piggy tails, little tiny horns.
Okay, not to sound like your dad, but maybe you should give her a chance, bud.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I hear the ice cream truck a-ringing and I want me a fudgie buddy.
(MILEY CHUCKLES) - Okay, that was creepy good.
- Thank you.
Now, would it kill you to open up a little and at least try to be friends with her? Hey, Traci's having that big Halloween party tomorrow night.
- Why don't we take her with us? - No way.
I ain't letting that pig calling, butter churning, evil-doing hayseed anywhere near the Hannah world.
Would you stop calling her names? Well, howdy, cuz.
I found you this pretty shell over by the tide pools.
Yeah, pretty.
A pretty good place to hide a poisonous hermit crab.
What are you doing? I'm ruining your "little plan" to poison me and throw me down a well again! Miley, stop, there's nothing in there.
(CRYING) I was just trying to be nice to y'all.
See how clever she is? She tricks me into accusing her of something that she didn't do so I would look stupid.
Well, it worked.
You look pretty stupid.
I told you, she's an evil genius.
Hey, Jackson.
Oh, man, it's not scary enough.
It needs something.
But what? Think, think.
Hey, Mile.
What happened at the beach today with you and Luann? She's up in the guest room, she's awfully upset.
Well, it could have something to do with the fact that I accused her of trying to kill me.
Yeah, that has been known to offend a person.
- Do you really think I'm being unfair? - Yeah, I do, bud.
But I also know you're awfully good at fixing things when you put your mind to it.
Okay, fine.
I'll go talk to her.
That's my girl.
If I'm not down in 10 minutes, check all the local wells.
(CLICKS) Luann, you okay? Yep, just packing up my bags and working on my plan for world domination.
(SIGHS) Okay, look, maybe, possibly, it's conceivable that I haven't treated you completely fairly.
And I wanted to say I was sorry.
- Really? Yeah.
The truth is, I always was a little jealous.
Well, I think it's time that we took the past and buried it.
Yeah, kind of like what we used to do with Aunt Pearl's roadkill ravioli.
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
There was always gravel in mine.
Yeah, she said it gave it that special crunch.
Well, if you still want to stay, there's a really great Hollywood Halloween party that I'd love to take you to.
You really want me to come with you'ins? I really want you to come with me-ins.
(SNIFFS) I'm touched.
Hey, the limo's here to take us to Traci's party.
- Are you ready? - Oh, yeah.
Let's do this.
- Where's Luann? - Oh, she can't go.
She was at the beach boogie boarding all day and got a really bad sunburn.
Oh, I hate that.
But at least you two are friends now.
- Yep, best of pals.
Let's go.
- Okay.
Oh, I forgot my purse.
- I'll meet you out in the limo, okay? - Okay.
Miley, Miley, Miley.
I can't believe you didn't see this coming.
Maybe if you wouldn't have wasted your time in singing classes and went to rodeo camp with the rest of us, you wouldn't be stuck in this situation.
What's that, girl? You want Hannah to perform at the party? Good idea.
(SINGING OFF-KE Y) You done got the best of both worlds Oh, yeah.
Horrible, ain't it? Wait till your fans hear that.
That'll do wonders for your career.
Happy Halloween, cuz.
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (SPLUTTERS) (GHOSTLY VOICE ECHOING) (RINGS DOORBELL) Trick or treat! (EXCLAIMING) (KIDS SCREAMING) Wait, kids, you forgot your candy! Yes! There is no way that Dontzig's house is scarier than ours.
(CHEERING) What is wrong with you? You're supposed to hand out candy, not traumatize my kid.
I'm sorry.
No, no, you don't understand.
See, it's just that We're just trying to be as scary as the guy next door.
You mean Mr.
Happy Pumpkin Man? - Who? - Hey, hey, kids! (ALL CHEERING) Oh, is mean old Mr.
Stewart scaring you? Yeah! I don't believe this.
Why would somebody wanna scare little children? It's sick.
I'm not surprised.
At Christmas they put out a one-eyed Santa.
- No! - It's true.
I've seen it.
But it's Halloween.
And you're in Mali-boo.
(EXCLAIMING IN FEAR) Come on, kids.
Let's all go back to my house and everyone can have another ride on the pony.
(ALL CHEERING) (SINGING) He's Mr.
Happy Pumpkin man Giving out candy like no one can He's Mr.
Happy Pumpkin man Well, Stewarts, you win.
You're the scariest.
And everybody in the neighborhood hates you.
I got you! (LAUGHS) (SINGING) I'm Mr.
Happy Pumpkin man Wait up, kids! I'm sorry.
Hey, hey! Don't forget your candy! Get away from our children! I've got pepper spray! Dad? Jackson? Oliver, I need your mom to drive me to a Halloween party now! Yes, you can come.
I can't believe Luann would tie you up and try to ruin your life.
(SIGHS) You know, this is gonna make my date tomorrow night with her a little awkward.
What are you gonna do when you see her? I'm gonna rip off her wig and punch her in the nose.
Right now just help me find her.
It's not gonna be that hard.
Come on, she's gonna be the only one in there that looks exactly like me.
(THE OTHER SIDE OF ME PLAYING) Oh, boy.
Yeah, this is gonna be a little harder than I thought.
(I GOT NERVE PLAYING) Oh, boy, these gummy ghouls are better than Pappy's mountain taffy! Man, you've been hanging around your cousin so much you're starting to talk like her.
Stop loading up on candy.
People are watching.
Well, of course they are.
I'm a celebrity.
Hannah.
(KISSING NOISES) You've been here an hour and you haven't said a word about my little Hannah-ween surprise.
Oh, you mean everyone dressed like me? Yeah, it's about as stupid as a vegetarian having breakfast at the Beef N' Waffle.
What are you talking about? I'm talking about stupid.
Just like your stupid little voice.
What's the matter, you got some candy corn stuck up in your nozzle? I have a deviated septum.
And I own it.
What is wrong with you? You've been acting weird since we got here.
It's like you want the whole party to hate you Oh, my gosh, you're Luann! Well, it took you long enough, Lulu.
It's Lola.
Lilly, Lola, Lulu, you might as well go by Purple Head.
What do you use for conditioner, grape jelly? Hey, waiter.
Fetch me some peanut butter, I'd like to make me a sandwich.
(LAUGHS) (SNORTS) I gotta get you out of here before you blow Miley's secret.
Well, shut my mouth.
I wasn't even thinking about pulling this wig off till you done brought it up.
That'll really fix her wagon.
Good job, gumdrop.
(LAUGHS MALICIOUSLY) I had a dream like this once.
Except the room was full of Jessica Simpsons and I had more than one chest hair.
Focus.
We have to find the real fake Hannah.
(GRUNTING) Ha! I've got you! I am not gonna let you ruin my best friend's life.
I am your best friend.
You can't fool me with that fake Miley accent.
I am Miley! I have to go find Luann! You're not going anywhere without your nose.
(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN NASALLY) Lilly.
Lilly, she's telling the truth.
Oliver? What are you doing here? (IN NASAL VOICE) I needed his mom to drive me here 'cause you and Luann rode off in my limo! - Miley? - You think? Sorry.
We gotta find her quick.
She's about to rip off her wig and blow your secret.
- She wouldn't.
- She would.
And she thought of it all herself.
Remember, no matter what she says, she's evil.
Looking for Hannah.
Not you.
Not you.
But, hi.
Not you, but, girl, aren't you styling.
Hey, folks, it's me, the real Hannah Montana! I've got a little announcement for y'all.
You guys might want to get out your fancy Hollywood phone cameras for this one.
Hey, guys, I found her! She's on stage! Good work.
Hold on, guys, I got a little something stuck in my craw.
(SNORTS) (SPITS) (ALL GROANING) Bingo! Well, she's gonna have a real hard time spitting with my fist in her mouth.
You can't! You get into something with her, she might rip off your wig, too.
Have no fear, ladies, the masked musketeer has a plan.
Great.
My life is in the hands of Count Chesthair.
So, lookie here, y'all are about to see something you never expected to see, the other side, the other side, the other side of (CROWD CHATTERING) (EXCLAIMING) Look at that.
Magic.
And spitting.
Neat.
Why don't we have dessert now? Bring out the Hannah banana cream pie! You are so busted, Luann.
Guys, you grabbed the wrong one in the dark! I'm Miley! Nice try, you backwoods witch.
These are my best friends.
They're not gonna fall for that.
Tell her.
- You got any idea? - Not a clue.
Guys, we have got to get her out of here before she reveals my secret.
You mean my secret.
Wait a minute.
I have an idea.
I know how to tell which is the real Miley.
- Both of you kiss me.
- Okay.
(EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) That's Miley.
And what has all this taught you? That parents should believe their kids when they tell them their cousins are evil.
And? That I should always take my cell phone when I leave the house in case my daughter gets tied up in her closet.
- And? - I'm sorry.
But you don't have to worry about it much longer.
Your uncle's on his way here to pick Luann up.
They'll be gone tomorrow.
That doesn't give me much time to get her back.
Like I've always told you, an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.
Stewart! Stewart, you gotta help me! Those candy grabbers are like piranha! They're coming by the bus load! It's like someone put an ad in the paper.
The paper? That's way too slow.
If somebody wanted to get information out fast, they'd just run down Pacific Coast Highway with a bullhorn.
You didn't.
Oh, yes, I did.
Got you! Okay, kids.
Come on down, don't be shy.
Curse you, Stewart! Curse you! (KIDS CHEERING) Dad, what about revenge making the whole world blind? I was teaching that to you, it's too late for me.
(NEIGHING) Hey, Dad, Dontzig's pony followed me home.
Can we keep him? (IMITATING HORSE) Please? All I need is a really big litter box.
I'm just gonna take him up to my room, okay? (DOORBELL RINGS) Hey, Miley, tell your cousin her daddy's here! Put your drawers on, Robbie Ray, your brother's here! Good to see you, too, Bobbie Ray.
Well, smack my goat and call me stupid, this sure is one humdinger of a shack you got yourself.
Stewart, I need that pony back, it's a rental.
Hey.
Hey.
(EXCLAIMS) Hey.
Two Stewarts! (SCREAMING) Is that that pain-in-the-keister neighbor you've been telling me about? Yep.
- He sure runs fast, don't he? - He sure does.
- Doggies! - Doggies! 

MILEY: Those are your nominees for Best On Screen Kiss.
And the Teenie Award goes to "You know, if we'd been able to finish our kiss on Zombie High, "we might've won this thing.
" (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) - (WHISPERS) Your turn.
- Oh.
Right.
"Oh, Jake, I bet you say that to all your co-stars.
"Push Jake.
" (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I mean And the Teenie (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And the Teenie for Best Teen Kiss goes to Frankie Muniz and his pillow in The Lonely Sophomore.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Good job, Frankie.
"Unfortunately, Frankie's doing a movie in Romania.
" "And the pillow has a hot date with a bunk bed.
"Hold for laughter.
" (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) God, I did it again! (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) We'll be accepting this on Frankie's behalf.
Thank you.
Oh, and next year, I promise I'll do better.
Toodles.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (GROANING) Man! Darn it! Come on.
People love it when we mess up.
- Besides, I think you did great.
- Thanks.
Hold for applause.
Great to see you again, Hannah.
Can't wait to get you back on the show to finish that kiss.
- I'll have my people call your people.
- Great.
My people will be waiting.
That would be me.
I'm Lola, her most important people.
Which is why I may look familiar, but we've never met.
Not even in school or anything.
Because I'm home-schooled.
In Canada.
Where the moose are.
Okay.
Nice to meet you, too.
Bye.
Bye, Jake.
"Where the moose are"? "In Canada"? "Where I'm home-schooled"? - Lola, way to keep your cover.
- Oh, who cares? Hey, you know what? I heard he broke up with that girl at school.
That means the zombie slayer's available.
I know.
I can't wait to go to school on Monday.
Maybe Jake and I can finally get together.
(CAMERAS CLICKING) Or not.
Sorry.
No, I'm fine with it.
I'm cool.
I'm really, really fine.
Oopsies.
Frankie won't be when he finds out you tore off his Teenie's tiny head.
Sorry, Teenie.
It's okay.
(SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Okay, you got enough shots.
Can we have a little privacy now? Thanks.
Wow.
First the Teenie, now this.
You got it bad.
I know.
And what's worst is, Jake liked you first, and you turned him down.
Otherwise that could have been you over there giving Jake little popcorn kissies.
- Lilly, you got ice cream on your face.
- Where? Right there.
Thanks.
Hey, need a napkin? No thanks, I'm good.
Speak for yourself.
But, you know, a girl can never have too many napkins.
- Thanks.
I'm Miley.
- I'm Willis.
(EXAGGERATED LAUGHTER) You are so funny, so funny.
Here, take a seat.
You come here often? No.
I just moved from Seattle.
(EXAGGERATED LAUGHTER) Seattle.
There is no stopping you now, is there? (EXAGGERATED LAUGHTER) I don't get it either.
So, where are you going to school? Eastwood Prep.
But I'm graduating.
You're a senior? Because we're just Starving! Why don't I go get us all some pretzels? Wait here, Walter.
It's Willis.
(EXAGGERATED LAUGHTER) Still so funny.
You just keep on killing me! - Make sure he doesn't go anywhere.
- What are you doing? You can't flirt with a senior.
He's old enough To make Jake jealous? So he'll realize I'm the girl he really wants? Ooh, diabolical.
Or should I say guy-abolical? (LAUGHING) You shouldn't say anything.
Oh, hi, Jake.
I didn't notice you here on the beach.
Oh, hey, Miley.
I didn't notice you here on the beach either.
This is Holly.
She's an actress.
Oh, yeah.
I saw you in that commercial.
You know, the one where you had to have that really uncomfortable talk with your mom.
I hope everything worked out.
That wasn't really my mom, okay? Well, as long as the toe fungus is gone.
So, who's your friend? Oh, that's Willis.
He's from Seattle.
You know, uh, the Coffee Capital of America.
He drinks it black.
- Holly drinks espresso.
- Willis shaves.
- Holly waxes.
- Willis is a senior.
Wow.
Toodles.
Hey, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to this bowling party with me.
Sure, of course I'll go to the bowling party with you.
With all of your senior classmates.
Oh, Holly.
Open up.
Oh, Willis.
Are you hungry? Why did Miley just shove a pretzel in that guy's mouth? I think it's supposed to look romantic.
Okay, Dad, at the parent-teacher conference, you may hear a little something about a belching contest.
I just want you to know that it never happened.
And I was not the champion! I can't approve of that kind of behavior.
But I guess better out the attic than out the basement.
Thanks, Dad, but don't try that kind of humor with Ms.
Kunkle.
She doesn't have a funny bone in her body.
I bet I'll get a giggle out of her.
I know she hasn't heard this one.
- Knock-knock.
- No, no, no, Dad! No "knock-knock" jokes, all right? No jokes at all! If you even think something funny, I'm going to get detention! (SCOFFS) Stop exaggerating.
No one who dedicates themself to a life of educating kids - could be that mean.
- Oh, yeah? Stewart, last night your father tried to tell me a knock-knock joke.
No.
I swear, I told him not to.
Are you blinking? There is no blinking in my class! I'm not blinking! Oh, no! That's it! I couldn't do anything to your father.
But you (EVIL LAUGHTER) Solitary for a week! - Not the cage! - Oh, yes, the cage.
But I'm so young.
Please.
No! (EVIL LAUGHTER) (STAMMERING) Dad, please, just get in, and then get out.
All right? Just save all that wonderful charm for the checkout lady at the market.
That reminds me, I can use some of my funny food puns to break the ice with her.
It's grape to meet you, ma'am.
(GROANS) Lettuce sit and talk.
Whoa doggies, I'm on fire! I'm doomed.
(BELL RINGING) You can't go out with this guy.
You start bowling with a senior, the next thing you know you're go-karting with a college guy! It's madness! (LAUGHING) Hey, who sprinkled drama queen in your oatmeal this morning? Relax, you guys.
I was never going to go out with Willis.
I just said it to make Jake jealous.
So, how are you going to get out of the bowling party? I'll just call Willis and tell him the truth.
That I totally forgot I'm allergic to rental shoes.
Perfect.
- Hey, guys.
Hey, Jake.
So I guess I'll, uh, see you at the bowling alley tonight.
Yeah, that sounds What? Well, I just thought that Holly and I would have a great time bowling, too.
- So we'll probably bump into you there.
- I'm sure you would, but, uh, - I'm not sure if I'm still going to - Aw.
Did your senior boyfriend already break up with you? No.
I'm just not sure if I'm wearing my red top or my green, just in case you're looking for me.
- Thanks for being so thoughtful.
- My pleasure.
- See you there.
- Yes, you will.
Don't worry.
I've got him right where I want him.
Which is where? I have no idea.
Dad, the weirdest thing happened at school today.
I think Ms.
Kunkle actually - Smiled.
- Is that so? Some thought it was a trick of the light, and I had my money on a gas bubble.
Did she seem okay when you talked to her last night? Karen? Yeah, she seemed fine.
And later at coffee Whoa! You and Kunkle had coffee? You're kidding.
And an apple crumbly.
I can't believe it.
You went all fruit funny and now Ms.
Kunkle is Smiling.
Really? I didn't do anything but talk with her.
But I was having a pretty good hair day.
Wait a minute.
If after a half hour with you and your hair she's smiling, imagine what she'd be like after a real date with you.
Now, class, the best way to learn about the wave particle theory of physics is To catch some gnarly waves! Come on, Kunkle-cakes! Surf's up, baby! Coming, hunky-monkey! - Does this mean I get an A? - This means everybody gets an A! Cowabunga! (ALL CHEERING) Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson? - Jackson? - Huh? Sorry, Dad.
Uh, so when are you going to see her again? - We never talked about it.
- Well, get on it, Romeo! It's time to runkle with the Karen Kunkle, please.
But, Jackson, don't you dare Hello, Karen.
- Uh, yeah, this is Robbie Stewart.
- Work it, Dad, work it.
I got a bad feeling about this.
Come on, we'll just stay long enough for Jake to see me with Willis and then we'll be out of here.
No problem.
I don't see Willis.
Just look for a bunch of cool older guys.
(LAUGHING) Hey, Miley! Hi! Hey, Willis.
Who's this? My best friend, Mike.
It's that girl I was talking to you about.
What do you think? Hubba-hubba.
Best friend? How old is he? I know, I know.
He looks 10, but he's really 12.
Uh, isn't it weird hanging out with guys so much younger than you? Well, truth is, Mike's older than me.
- How old are you? - Eleven.
And three-quarters.
- You're 11? - And three-quarters.
What you talking about, Willis? - How can you be 11? - And three-quarters.
Not helping! - And take that giraffe off your head.
- It's a dragon.
Who cares? It's a balloon hat.
Look on the bright side, she can baby-sit him for extra money.
- You said you were graduating! - I am.
Elementary school! Sorry.
I thought it'd be cool to be at the party with You know, an older babe.
I can't believe you used me! (GROANS) You mean, just like you used him? Okay, fine.
I used him.
It was wrong, I learned my lesson and I'll never do it again.
- Jake alert.
- Right after this.
- Quick, put your arm around me.
- Wow.
I'm touching shoulder.
Willis, come on, they're cutting the cake! It's shaped like a castle! - In a minute.
- Well, you better hurry up if you want any of the pudding moat.
Pudding moat? Remember when you used to like cake more than girls? Yeah.
Kids.
- Oh, just go get some.
- Maybe just a taste.
All right, Lilly, quick.
Let's get out of here before Hey, Lilly.
Miley? Hello.
Isn't that your senior boyfriend over there? No, that kid just looks like him.
I am King Willis! And has the same name.
- Hi, Miley.
- And knows me.
(HUMMING) - Dad, what are you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing? Thanks to you, I'm cooking Chicken � la Kunkle.
At least take off the apron.
You can't have a woman over for a date looking like you just got off the late shift at the Waffle Wagon.
It's not a date, Son.
It's two adults having dinner because one adult's son hoodwinked him into it.
All right.
Whatever you say.
Just walk through that.
- I don't think so.
- Dad.
Get that skunk water away from my chicken! What's wrong with you? Would you just work with me a little bit here, Dad? Now tilt your nose up, it's time to trim the jungle.
Keep that weed whacker away from me! (DOORBELL RINGING) Oh, man, she's here.
At least yoosh! I wouldn't do that even if I knew what it meant.
(TRIMMER WHIRRING) - Hello, Jackson.
- Ms.
Kunkle, come on in.
Karen.
Orange you a sight for sore eyes.
Oh, Robbie, you are so punny! (KAREN LAUGHS) - Smells incredible.
- And it tastes even better.
Mmm.
Wonderful.
But I think it could use just a dash of tarragon.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We got a, uh, pretty delicate balance of spices here.
Wouldn't want to throw it out of whack, but thanks for the thought.
Well, I'm just talking about a dash.
I'm a pretty fair cook myself, you know.
That may be, but this recipe's been in the family for generations.
Well, that doesn't mean it can't be improved.
Uh, it was good enough to take second place for Recipe of the Year at the Tennessee State Fair.
Well, maybe if it had a dash of tarragon, it would've won.
Hey, now, hey.
Let's not forget about the apple crumbly.
Good times, good times.
Well, I remember the apple because someone else ate all of the crumbly.
And it was delicious because it didn't have any tarragon in it.
Hey, hey, who wants to get a pizza? They actually put cheese in the crust now.
Mmm.
You know, everybody's entitled to their opinion.
But in this case, yours is wronger than a monkey driving a lawn mower! (IMITATING MONKEY) Well, my opinion couldn't be any wronger than your grammar, cowboy.
Oh, pshaw, what's a dash of tarragon between friends? Okay, that's it.
The next one that says tarragon is going to be gone.
Tarragon.
Tarragon.
Tarra I am so gone! Dad, what about my A? Oh, now I see what you're up to.
Son, I'm sorry, but if you want good grades you're going to have to earn them.
What kind of a father are you? Wait a minute, I can save this! Ms.
Kunkle! Ms.
Kunkle, wait! Ms.
Kunkle, come back! You guys make such a great pear! Turn around! I'm holding a pear! (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) It's punny! Oh, great.
There's Jake.
You're going to have to face him sooner or later.
I choose later.
All right, fine.
But I can hear him already.
"Hey, Miley.
What are you and Willis doing tomorrow night? "Hot date on the teeter-totter?" (LAUGHING) Looks like he wanted to try it out on them first.
I guess I do deserve this.
I did use Willis.
Boy, did you ever.
It was like you had a love cold and he was the tissue.
"Willis, can I borrow you for a second? (SNEEZES) "Goodbye, Willis.
" I already admitted I was wrong.
You don't have to blow my nose in it.
- This is such a disaster.
- Not totally.
I bowled a 280.
- The bumpers were up.
- You never let me have anything.
Hey, Miley.
Oh, we just heard I know.
I know.
I went on a date with an 11-year-old.
But in my defense, he could totally pass for 16.
- Without the balloon hat.
- Or the ninja stickers.
Hey! Uh, I was just going to tell you this funny joke Jake told us.
But you going out with an 11-year-old is so much funnier! (ALL LAUGHING) Awkward.
I'm just going to go see what that joke was.
Maybe Jake didn't tell anybody.
Why wouldn't he tell anybody? Any other boy would.
I've got to find out.
All right, Jake.
What's going on? Why haven't you told anybody about me and balloon boy? Why would I do that? You seemed so miserable last night and I didn't want to make it any worse.
Really? That's kind of nice.
It's like I've been trying to tell you since the beginning.
- I'm really not a bad guy.
- Maybe not.
Plus, I thought it was kind of cool that you went to all that trouble just to make me jealous.
Whoa, slow down there, ego boy.
Why would I be trying to make you jealous? Besides, you have a girlfriend.
Holly? She's not my girlfriend.
We have a movie coming out so we've been hanging out as a publicity thing.
Why didn't you tell me that before? Uh Well, I think I, uh Wait a minute.
I know why.
Because you were trying to make me jealous.
- Was not! - Was too.
- Admit it, Jake, you like me! - No, you like me! Just say it! - No, you say it! - No, you! No, you! I guess this means we're kind of together.
I guess it does.
So, do you want to go out sometime? Or do you want to ask me since you're the guy? Well, I don't really know how to say it.
Come on, it's not that hard.
Well, okay.
You want to go out with me - four months from this Saturday? - Yeah, that sounds Huh? Frankie Muniz was going to do this movie, and he dropped out.
I fly to Romania tonight.
Yeah, but you can't just leave.
You kissed me.
Well, hey, it's not my fault I got a big part in a movie.
I know, but you kissed me! I know.
It was great.
And now I don't have to go off and wonder what it would have been like.
Yeah, it would have been awful for you to have left without planting one on me.
Exactly! So I guess it is four months.
So I'm going to give you a little something extra to remember me by.
Whoa! That's how I plant one.

Okay, I want everybody to close your eyes and find your happy place.
Now imagine all the good things in your life.
Great shoes, perfect hair - Very berry lip shine.
- Very berry lip shine.
(BOTH EXCLAIM) (MIMICKING SIZZLE) Wow, even though I can't see it, it's still annoying.
I know, now it's in my happy place.
Okay, open your eyes.
Now that you had time to think about what you have, it's time to think about those who aren't as lucky.
Yes, it's time again for our school to raise money for the (IMITATING DRUM ROLL) United People's Relief Fund.
And you, my little relievers, are going to help the less fortunate.
Like Ms.
Dawson, the librarian? Ms.
Dawson is not less fortunate.
She chooses to dress that way.
It's too bad, she could be all that and a bowl of pudding.
I'm sorry I'm late, Mr.
Corelli.
I was on my way to school when I had to wrestle a cat away from a baby bird and then I felt sorry for the cat so I had to go to the pet store to get him some food and then I saw this lost dog with a sore paw Whoa, Sarah.
Why is it every time I talk to you I get the urge to give blood And call my mom? Which, if you knew my mom, it's sort of the same thing.
I'm sorry, where were we? You were crushing on Ms.
Dawson.
(EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) No, I wasn't.
I was thinking about pudding.
Moving on.
United People's Relief Fund.
Like last year, the person or team that raises the most cha-ching gets a day off school, picture in the newspaper.
Yeah! And a $300 gift card to the Malibu Mall.
(BELL RINGING) Finally, lunch time! We have to win.
I need a new deck for my skateboard.
I just want to win so Amber and Ashley don't.
Otherwise it's gonna be another year of listening to them gloat.
Hey, guys, look, we know we gloated last year and we feel really bad about that.
So we just wanted to say good luck.
May the best fundraiser win.
Okay, something doesn't smell right here.
Sorry.
I knew I shouldn't have had that breakfast burrito.
I'm talking about Amber and Ashley.
They're up to something.
- And we just have to watch our backs.
- You got it.
(SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Okay, this has been going on for 2 hours.
What gives, people? - Hi, Miley.
- Hi, Lilly.
Okay, this has Amber and Ashley written all over it.
Actually, it has "dork" and "dorkier" written all over it.
That's it! They are gonna pay for this! Wait, wait, was I "dork" or "dorkier"? It's important to me.
What's important is not letting Amber and Ashley win the charity drive again.
I'm sick of seeing their snobby faces everywhere I turn.
(SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) Check it out, losers.
This is as close as you'll ever get to one of these.
We'll see about that.
We'll knock every door until our knuckles bleed.
We'll beg, and we'll plead, and we won't take no for an answer.
No! No! Sic him, Butchie.
(DOG BARKING) No! Okay, I think it's time we kick it up a notch! One, two, three, let's bring the cha-ching! Hi, we're juggling for charity! (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING) Howdy, y'all.
We're plucking for charity.
(SINGING) and a partridge in a pear tree Merry Christmas and don't forget the less fortunate! Christmas? Last time I dozed off it was September.
The grandkids'll be here any minute.
I've gotta get the elves out of the attic.
(WHOOPING) Good game, Son.
- I almost didn't score a point.
- Don't feel bad, Dad.
One of these days, maybe you'll finally win one.
If he wanted to he could win them all, fool.
He's just playing you.
- Why would he do that? - He feels sorry for you.
I mean, look at you, for a basketball player, you're a short little fella.
Dad, that's not true, right? I mean, you're not letting me win? Of course not, Son.
I think you're really, really good.
(STUTTERING) What is all that? I'm just cooling myself down after a brutal beating.
It is a tad bit humid out here.
Yeah, yeah, nice try.
But I know what that means, all right? Now I want you to stand in front of the basket and try this time.
- Oh, Son, I'm a little tired.
- Dad, please.
I have to know.
(SIGHS) Okay, but just remember, you asked for it.
All right.
Here we go.
All right, let's see what you got down low, Oldylocks! Oh, man, he was right! You let me win.
Wait a minute.
Do you always let me win? I'm sorry, Son.
It's just that I love seeing how happy you get when you win.
Plus, when you lose, you do make that little pouty face.
- I do not.
- There it is.
Well, this ends right now! I'm gonna beat you at something, Dad! And I am gonna beat you so bad.
Son, you got your health.
You got a nice car.
Why go looking for unhappiness? (IMITATING CHICKEN) - Okay, that does it.
Name your game.
- All right.
One, two, three, four, I declare a thumb war.
(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN) It's okay, Son, it's not your fault.
You got your mom's thumbs.
I have girl thumbs? Sarah, show me the money! Wow, dudette, how'd you raise so much? Well, I learned good charity skills from my parents.
They met at a Red Cross blood drive, and then honeymooned in the Peace Corps - building aqueducts for - Great story.
Next! Ah, yes.
The three amigos.
Show me the money! - Seriously.
Show me the money.
- That's all we could raise.
- Aren't you going to hit the gong? - Oh, I got a special one for you.
(EXCLAIMS) (MIMICKING) "Aren't you going to hit the gong?" It's better than no gong at all.
Okay, maybe we're not winning, but thanks to Sarah, neither are Amber and Ashley.
Last year's champions are at it again! Looks like somebody's going for the two-peat.
How'd you guys earn so much money? Simple.
We just went to the B of D.
- What's that? - The Bank of Dad.
That is so unfair.
We worked so much harder than you.
Yeah! We walked ten miles, faked six different accents and sang The Twelve Days of Christmas 58 stinking times.
Wow, you're right.
You did work harder.
We're just smarter And richer.
(EXCLAIMING) (MIMICKING SIZZLE) I don't care what it takes.
This time, I refuse to let them get the better of us.
Miley? - Not now, Oliver.
Okay.
- This is a good idea, Coop.
- I told you, man.
With Ping-Pong you don't have to be tall, strong or good-looking.
Exactly! Wait a minute, I'm good-looking.
Sure you are.
Now, grab a paddle and let's get our Ping-Pong on.
All right, bring it on, baby! (CAT YOWLING) Sorry, Mr.
Fluffers! Yeah! (WHOOPING) Great, now I have to teach you how to dance.
Okay, here he comes! (ALL SIGHING) Wow, a three-part sigh.
Usually when I hear a sigh like that, my wallet hurts.
Daddy, I know you already gave a big donation, but Amber and Ashley's parents Now, you know what I always say, honey.
You can buy a thirsty man a cow, and he'll have all the milk he wants but he still won't have enough to wash down his cookies.
- What? - Huh? He said he's happy to give to charity but this is a chance for us to learn to be creative and raise the money ourselves.
And then something about cookies.
Maybe Hannah can ask a few people.
Maybe Hannah can ask a lot of people.
(SINGING) Who said, who said I can't be Superman I say, I say that I know I can Who said, who said I won't be President I say, I say you ain't seen nothing yet Whoa, yeah Who said? Come on, yeah That's right (CROWD CHEERING) Thank you! Thank you all.
Now, before I start my next song, I would just like to give a shout out to a great charity called United People's Relief.
So, show your love and make a donation.
Guys, please! Paper money only, people! I bruise like a cantaloupe! I can't believe how much Hannah pulled in.
I know! And it was easier than finding a mullet at a truckers' convention.
- Huh? - What? Y'all wouldn't last I just can't wait to see the look on Amber and Ashley's faces when they find out we won.
I can't believe we lost.
(WAILING) (IMITATE FIZZLING) (DOORBELL RINGING) Hello, sir or madam, would you like to donate - Oh, hi, Miley.
You live here? - Yeah, come on in, Sarah.
- So how's the collecting going? - Pretty good.
I woke up at 4:00 this morning so I could raise money at the fish market, and then I caught the end of the graveyard shift at the meat plant, then sunrise aerobics at the Yoga Mat - You get up this early every morning? - No, on Saturdays I sleep in till 5:30.
Then I go to an old folks' home and serve breakfast.
Why am I not surprised? I just really want that gift card.
So I can buy a bunch of clothes and then donate them to needy children.
Needy children? You'd donate the whole gift card? You wouldn't even buy yourself a pair of socks? I already have two pairs of socks.
A pair and a spare.
Who needs more than that? Normal people? Whoa! How did you guys raise so much money? You must have worked really, really hard.
(COUGHS) Well (STUTTERING) What we did was - We did this thing.
- Thing! (CLEARING THROAT) Yeah, and Excuse me! - Excuse us.
- Yeah.
Guys, we've got to give the Hannah money to Sarah.
- What? - No.
Yeah, she's worked harder than any of us.
And she's the only one doing it for the right reasons.
Reasons, schmeasons, I want my new skateboard! Lilly, you know she deserves to win.
And when she does win we still get to see Amber and Ashley crushed like the little bugs they are! Okay.
Let's go give Miss Goody Two-socks the money.
Hey, Sarah, we decided that you should try the Brustroms down the street.
They're loaded.
I mean, in case they're not home, we'd like to make a donation to your fund-raising.
No, I can't take your money.
You guys worked really hard.
- Not as hard as you.
- Trust us.
No.
I couldn't sleep at night if I took credit for someone else's work.
And that would be really bad considering how early I get up.
It never ends.
Besides, I still have a chance to win.
There's a carnival at the beach tonight.
And if I stand under the Loop de Loop, I might be able to catch some spare change.
While I dodge the vomit.
Okay, bye.
We've got to find a way to make her take the money.
Yeah.
And maybe an umbrella.
I bet she'd take a donation from a generous celebrity.
- I bet she would.
- Yeah, right.
Where are we gonna find one of those? You'd think he'd learn by now.
(BOTH EXCLAIMING) - Not today.
- Take that.
- Come on, big boy! - Slam! I did it.
I won.
I beat my daddy! I beat my daddy! Well, I'll be darned.
You beat me.
You actually beat the old man.
Oh, come on, Dad.
I didn't beat you.
I destroyed you, I crushed you.
I buried you under an avalanche of Jackson.
- Nobody likes a sore winner, Son.
- Who's pouting now? Nobody's pouting.
Whatever you say, Mr.
Pouty McPoutpants.
Okay, I'm just gonna go get my towel.
Pouty McPoutpants.
(EXCLAIMS TRIUMPHANTLY) See that.
I beat you again.
Okay, Jackson, it's not like we was having a race to see who could get to the towels first.
Even if we were, you'd lose.
You know, everything doesn't have to be a competition, Son.
- Okay, now you're just being silly.
- Am I? (WHOOPS) - Best two out of three? - Oh, you are so on.
Oh, yeah! Thank you so much for donating to United People's Relief.
Okay.
There she is.
All right, let's just donate the money and get out of here before anyone spots Hannah.
- Hey.
- Hi, would you like to donate to You And you're here And Shh! - I'm guessing she's a fan.
- You think? Sarah, come on, wake up, Sarah.
Look, there's a kitten up a tree.
What? Kitten? Where? I could have sworn I saw Hannah Montana! Shh! Look, it's Hannah Montana! Oh, boy.
They're right behind us.
Now what? Quick, up here.
Yippie ki-yay.
(KIDS CHATTERING) Where'd she go? Where's Hannah Montana? Look! There she goes.
- I meant that way! - I meant that way! You better split up! - Something ain't right.
- You look good in purple.
Thank you.
Okay.
I know we're close, but this is just ridiculous.
(STAMMERING) Oh, wow! You, you.
Want us to donate to United People's Relief.
I thought you'd never ask.
Lola, give her the money.
Lola, release! (GASPS) Don't you dare faint again.
You're welcome.
Goodbye.
- So, that went well.
- Yep.
By the way, thanks for pinching me back there in the ball pit.
I didn't pinch you, you pinched me.
This is going to be so great.
Yeah, after all our work, Sarah better be happy.
(SCOFFING) She better buy herself a new pair of socks.
And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, the winner of this year's fund raiser is (IMITATING DRUM ROLL) Mr.
Corelli.
- Oh, sorry.
Amber and Ashley! Yeah What? How could they have raised more money than I mean us I mean Sarah? Once we found out that someone had raised more money than we did, we just asked our parents to write another check.
Now, if you'll excuse us, we've got to do an interview for the newspaper.
I don't understand.
How did they find out how much money was raised? Oliver? Okay, maybe I bragged a little about how Sarah was going to beat them.
(SPLUTTERING) (SPLUTTERING) Button it.
I just feel bad for Sarah.
She's gonna be crushed.
- Yay, good for you! - Yeah, she's taking it real hard.
Sarah, why are you so happy? I thought you wanted to win.
It isn't about winning.
It's about raising money for charity.
That's all that really matters.
You know what, guys, she's right.
A little annoying, but right.
It's just a shame Amber and Ashley won.
They're never gonna do all the good stuff Sarah would've done.
Who knows, they might surprise you.
If I could just have a quote, how do you feel right now? Well, we're just so happy for the Universal Relief.
You mean United People's Relief.
Whatever you call it, people are going to be relieved.
Oh! And they didn't even tell you the best part.
They're going to take all the money from the gift card to buy clothes for the needy children.
- Needy who? - Needy who? Ooh! Not now! Wow.
You two are amazing.
This is gonna be a great story.
- Yeah, well, the truth is - But wait, there's more.
No, there's not.
Really.
Oh, come on.
Don't be modest.
Go ahead, Lilly.
They're going to spend their day off school volunteering and washing dishes at the soup kitchen.
Soup kitchen.
(EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) Oh, yeah.
Make sure you wear your hair nets, girls.
I'll see you guys at the soup kitchen! Now that's a picture I'll never get tired of.
(EXCLAIMING) (MIMICKING SIZZLE) (SINGING) Who said, who said I can't be worldwide I said, I said time is on my side Who said, who said I can't be ten feet tall I said, I said that I can have it all Who said, who said I can't be Superman I said, I said that I know I can Who said, who said I won't be President I say, I say you ain't seen nothing yet Whoa, yeah Who said Come on, yeah That's right 

Why did Dad call a family meeting? I hate family meetings.
What did you do? What do you mean, what did I do? What did you do? I didn't do anything.
I never do anything.
All right, listen, it doesn't matter who did what, just as long as we stay united, stay strong and stand together.
She did it! She did it! I saw it with my own two eyes! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Way to stay strong, you gutless little weasel.
Don't worry, Mile.
I know you didn't do anything.
- I didn't do anything either.
- I know.
Then why are you looking at me like that? It's fun.
- You are a cruel, cruel father.
- Oh, yeah? Would a cruel, cruel father give you these? Credit cards! My very first credit card.
Today, I am a woman.
And I'm still a dad.
And these cards are just used for emergencies only.
You could've told me that before I wasted the hug.
Look, the point is, these are just in case you get into trouble and I'm not around.
- Why are you still staring at me again? - It's still fun.
Thank you so much, Daddy.
I promise, you won't regret this.
Because we're both mature enough to handle this responsibility.
- Right, Jackson? - Absolutely.
Okay, I lost my card.
- Wait, you handed it to me, right? - And I've regretted it ever since.
(EXCLAIMS) There it is.
Hey, and my toothbrush! I've been looking for this since Tuesday.
You haven't brushed since Tuesday? Miles, don't be stupid.
I've been using yours.
(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Where do you think I should put my credit card? Should I put it in the little window where everybody can see it? Or is that too showy? Yeah, maybe I should just put it in one of the slots.
That says I have a credit card, but I ain't bragging about it.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I don't care, all right? Guys don't worry about dumb stuff like that.
Just give me a card and a pocket to put it in.
Where did I put that thing? No reason to worry, it's probably right next to your brain.
Uh-oh.
Now you'll never find it.
Where is it? Where is it? Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Right here, third slot from the top.
Nice placement.
Thank you.
- Can I hold it? - Sure.
But edges only.
- Duh! (SIGHING) - What do you think? - It's beautiful.
I think I'm in love.
You're wearing avocado, aren't you? You know what that does to me.
- What's wrong with you, boy? - It's free food, I'm a guy, do the math.
Where is that card? (GRUNTS) I think I found it.
That's right, I used it to spread the mustard.
Hello, what are we standing around here for? There's a huge flea market at the beach today.
And what's that, Cardy? I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go.
Let me go, please, please, please.
Lilly, I promised my dad I'd use it for emergencies only.
Of course I'll go to the flea market with you, but only to look.
I'm definitely not buying anything.
- I have to have these shoes.
- Why? They're shoes, I'm a girl, do the math.
Excuse me, sir, how much for these shoes? - For you, today, 75.
- 75 cents? She'll take a pair too, and a matching belt.
Oh, pretty and funny.
$ 75, and don't pretend to be surprised, rich Malibu child.
- Wow, I don't have that.
- Wow, then you don't have shoes.
Miley, it's a flea market, they want you to bargain.
- I know, but I'm no good at it.
- Well, lucky for you, I am.
Just follow my lead.
Look, I know you said you wanted $ 75 for the shoes, but we both know that you'll take $25.
So I'll make it easy for you, she'll give you $30.
I only have $25.
You hesitated, I'm dropping to $25.
You drive a hard bargain.
Tell you what, for you, $85.
- But it was just $ 75.
- That's before you made me mad.
Yeah, well, now you've made me mad and you've lost a sale.
I don't care.
Well, we're just gonna take our money and go.
- Okey-dokey.
- That's it, we're going.
Bye-bye.
- But I want my shoes.
- Trust me, he's just about to cave.
- Young lady, wait.
- Ha! Told you.
You have a doggy no-no on your shoes.
(ALL GROAN) Man.
I wanted new shoes, not doggy no-no shoes.
- This stinks.
- Tell me about it.
(CLOTH RIPPING) Why do I feel a sudden breeze? - 'Cause your back door's open.
- Quick, Lilly, hide me.
- Over here.
They sell skirts.
- Awesome skateboards.
- Where? - It can wait! - Excuse me.
- May I help you? - Weren't you just over there? - No, that is my brother.
- A tough cookie, huh? - I'll say.
He wanted me to give him $ 75 for a pair of shoes.
Oh, he's terrible.
I'll give you a much better price.
- Great.
How much for this skirt? - $ 74.
95.
- I can't afford that.
- $25 or we walk.
You walk! I'm getting a sunburn where I shouldn't.
Miley, think about it, this is a real emergency.
You could use your emergency credit card! I don't know, Lilly.
I see London, I see France, I see someone's underpants! Okay, fine, charge it.
And just for you, I'll throw in this lovely belt.
- Thank you.
- For $20 more.
Hey, you need something to hold up the skirt.
Very true.
And you know what'd look great with that skirt and the belt? - These shoes? - Really? Hey, Jackson.
Okay, I did not lose my credit card again.
It is exactly where I put it or left it or dropped it.
Oh, Dad is gonna have a cow.
Of course, once he sees what you've done, he's gonna have the whole barn.
It was an emergency.
Where do you want these, Miley? (STUTTERING) A really big emergency.
Finally, my fingers are cramping.
Hey, can I use that electric hand massager you bought? Hand massager.
Expensive, electric hand massager.
Okay, all right, all right.
I'm up on stage, you know, holding that microphone.
Yeah, and with the singing and I'm dancing and all of a sudden, my hand cramps up.
And I've gotta stop the whole concert and disappoint thousands of people or Hand massager.
Okay, fine, it made sense when I was signing for it.
How did the carpet make sense? The guy said it would match my shoes.
- Oh, man, I blew it big time.
- Yes.
Yes, you did.
Oh, I cannot wait for the next family meeting.
When Dad gives you the look.
(DISCORDANT NOTES PLAY) There you are, you little joker.
You are such a card.
Yes, you are.
A clean, pure, unswiped beauty.
Unlike somebody's dirty, soiled, little maxed-out mess.
Okay, whatever can get maxed-out can be maxed back in.
The guy gave me So all I have to do is take all this stuff back to the flea market.
What happened? Where did everybody go? - Where's the guy? - And his brother? Boy, when they say one day only, they're not kidding.
Oh, man, I can't believe this.
- Now there's only one thing left to do.
- Come clean and tell your dad? Heck, no, that's crazy talk.
I'm talking about the other only one thing.
- You wouldn't.
- You can't! I have to! You come to me now in your time of need and beg for help.
But when have you ever extended your hand in friendship? When have you ever given me the respect of calling me Godbrother? You made me wait 20 minutes so you could go put on some stupid costume and do a bad imitation? You hear that, Fluffy? More disrespect.
Fine.
I need your plotting, scheming, twisted mind, Godbrother.
This is so sweet! Of course I will help you.
But first I must serve hors d'oeuvres at the Greenwald-Demopoulos wedding.
Now, take Fluffy for a walk.
Miles, it's simple.
All you have to do is pay off the credit card bill before Dad ever even sees it.
But to do that, you need money.
Well Say hello to the carousel of cash.
I can't sell Hannah Montana stuff.
I use it.
Miles, you auction off some of this stuff on the Internet, your problems are solved.
There's stuff you've outgrown, things you never even wear.
- What about these earrings? - Those are important.
I used them in a video shoot last month and I'll probably never wear them again.
Exactly.
But some lucky girl out there will and she will pay through the nose for the chance.
Oh, that reminds me, a used Hannah Montana tissue, go for $37.
95.
How do you know that? That sinus infection you had last year, helped pay for my car.
Now blow, Daddy needs a set of spinners.
(BLOWING) Money, money, money We earn the money We get paid We get the cash We get the bash We earn the money We get the cash Money, money, money We earn the money Getting the cash We get paid Hey.
All the money in the world And the grand total is Wow! I never thought I'd say this, but, Jackson, I love you.
Love-schmuv, I'm still getting my 40%.
- 10.
- 30.
- 10.
- 20.
- 10.
- Fine.
Hey, Mile, you in there? Quick, hide the stash, it's the man! Come in! Hi, Daddy, I was just reading my purse.
This one was inspected by Inspector 15.
I love her work.
Well, sorry to bother you, honey, I just need those earrings back that you used in that video shoot last month.
What earrings? What video? What month? You know the fake blue sapphire and diamond ones that they let us keep? Well, it turns out that they gave us the real ones instead.
They want them back.
Can you believe that? No.
So here's a funny thought.
How about we just buy them? Sure, if you have $250,000 burning a hole in your britches.
What? Jackson, what are you doing in there? Oh, uh (STUTTERING) I I like to nap here sometimes.
The motion is soothing.
Normally, I'd pursue that, but right now I'm more concerned with the fact that I'm on the hook for $250,000.
You hear that Jackson? $250,000.
It seems like you two have a lot to talk about.
I'm just gonna take another spin around the park.
Come to think of it, he always fell asleep on the merry-go-round or else he would upchuck.
- So where's the earrings? - Right! The earrings.
Those earrings They're - They're at - At Lilly's? Okay, and I'll get them back to you as soon as I can, but right now I need to be alone with my clothes.
Are you okay? Of course, I'm fine, I'm a girl, we do that.
- Shoo, shoo.
Out, out, out.
- What about your brother? Let sleeping brothers lie.
This is all your fault.
If I go down, you're going down with me, bub.
Hey, nobody's going anywhere, except for 400 Grand Street, the home of Katherine McCord.
Otherwise known as the girl who bought your earrings.
- You really think she'd give them back? - Not to you.
But maybe to Hannah Montana.
Are you sure this is the right address? I mean it looks like it's been a while since anybody here has pumped up the party.
It's the right address.
Maybe you just have a bunch of older fans you never even knew about.
Here, let me try something.
Hey, it's Hannah Montana! Okay, maybe not.
My daughter lives in Montana.
How nice for you.
She's gotta be around here somewhere.
Oh, excuse me.
Do you know a Katherine McCord? Yes.
Yes, I do.
- Is she here? - Yes, she is.
Where is she? - That's her in the wheel chair.
- Thanks.
- Would it kill you to be a little social? - Yes.
She's Katherine McCord? She bought my earrings? And she's wearing them.
Ma'am? Ma'am? Wow, I haven't seen somebody this out since Uncle Earl thought he could last three minutes in the ring with that boxing kangaroo.
- What are you doing? - I'm just gonna take them off real gently and put the money in her lap, all right? (EXCLAIMS) You wanna get that close, you got to buy me dinner, sailor.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Hey, you're Hannah Montana.
Thanks for the earrings.
Yeah, about that.
See, I kind of sold them to you by mistake and I'd really like to buy them back.
Oh! And I'd like to be President of these 48 states, but that isn't gonna happen either.
- But - But But But wait.
If you act right now, we'll throw in two VIP concert tickets with backstage passes and preferred wheelchair parking.
Yes! Yeah, yeah! All this can be yours if you let me buy back my earrings which are, of course, completely worthless.
Not to me.
You see, I bought these earrings because I thought they'd make me look younger.
Unless she's 108, I don't think it's working.
And I'll have you know, ever since I put these on, Burt over there can't take his eyes off me.
You don't understand.
These earrings are worth - The world to her - Yes.
because they belong to her grandmother.
Yes, yes, they did.
In fact, she wore them on her wedding night.
Well, now that's different.
Of course I'll return them.
- Thank you.
- But only to your grandmother.
I can't trust you, blondie, you sold them in the first place.
- But - Is that a problem? No, of course not.
Actually, Grandma's down the hall visiting an old friend right now.
That's right.
She is.
Well, go get her, and make it fast.
I've got water aerobics in 10 minutes and I want to get the good noodle.
Yes, Miss McCord, I'd like you to meet my nana, Nana Montana.
My, aren't you a cute young thing? My, it's been a while since anybody called me that.
I hear that.
Barely.
(BOTH CHUCKLING) So, Nana, don't you want those earrings back that mean more to you than life itself? Why, yes.
Yes I do.
Oh, I'm so sorry for the misunderstanding.
Let me give these back to you.
But first, I could really use a glass of water.
Of course.
Hannah will get that for you, won't you, dear? - Sure.
- And one for me.
Lemon wedge, no ice.
Of course.
So you wore these on your wedding day.
- I want to hear all about it.
- Oh, yes, of course.
Morris was in the service.
He invented the Morris code, you know.
I'll never forget his proposal.
Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot, dot, dash.
Oh, how romantic.
I know, it still gives me the chills.
It's the air-conditioning.
It's like living in a meat locker.
It was a beautiful wedding.
I'll never forget dancing with President Lincoln.
Nana, you and your stories.
So what about those earrings? Don't rush us, honey, we're having such a nice talk.
Now make yourself useful and rub my neck.
Save some TLC for me.
Oh, yeah, I'm saving a little something something for you, Nana.
Promise me you always will be there for me Be the one to wash and brush my hair for me Show nothing but tender loving care for me Be my lady when I'm pushing 80 Promise me you'll tend to each and every need Treat me to your special therapy I'm counting on you so promise me And then Kong put me down to fight the airplanes.
Okay, guys, I got your bathtubs filled, but I'm not helping either of you into it! Now, please, how about those earrings? Oh, the earrings.
Yeah, I almost forgot.
But, first, I feel like a slice of rhubarb pie.
Okay, that's it, Grandma! Give me back my earrings! Not without my pie! My earrings! Hey, those are my earrings.
What are you doing? Trying to teach my kids a lesson about keeping things from their father! Aha! We got you, suckers! - Thanks for helping me out, Katherine.
- My pleasure, dear.
I haven't had this much fun since I performed on Broadway for President Lincoln, you sweet little twit.
Cut me some slack, that wig was pretty tight.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I should've come to you as soon as I messed up.
But I just didn't want you to think of me as irresponsible.
Well, I hope that you've learned the longer you avoid coming clean, the dirtier things get.
Which reminds me.
You're gonna be cleaning out the garage and several other places until you get that credit card paid off.
But, Daddy, there's spiders in the garage.
I'll wear gloves.
Hey, how did you find out anyway? Well, I've had my eye on those Internet auctions ever since I found out someone was selling used Hannah nose blowers.
I just wanna point out, that's a victimless crime.
Oh, there's gonna be a victim all right.
- Daddy, aren't you gonna go after him? - He won't get far.
Oh, yeah, you're right, he does have to stop at the pool.
( JACKSON EXCLAIMING) (SPLASH) At least we'll take him home clean.

(SINGING) I got nerve Yeah, yeah, yeah I got nerve Thanks for coming! See you all next time! Hey, take it easy, people.
She picks her nose just like everybody else.
- One nostril at a time.
- That is not true.
Right, she has people do it for her.
Hey, it was one time.
My nails were wet and Lilly offered.
Hey, Andy, don't bother with switching the limos tonight.
Nobody's following us.
And the sooner I can stop breathing the same air as my brother, the better.
Lighten up.
I'm just having a little fun.
You'd feel the same way if you had to sit backstage and listen to songs you've heard a thousand times.
- I get it, "You got nerve.
" - Yes, I do.
- Hey, Miles, you got your keys on you? - Who's taking care of who? Yeah, right, sorry.
Bye.
Jackson, very funny.
Come on, Jackson, let me in.
- Jackson! - Hey, Hannah! Got you! I knew if I kept following you, I'd find out where you live.
Live here? Me? No, I'm just here to visit a friend.
- Looks more like a boyfriend to me.
- A what? Say "Front Page!" (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Go away! You guys wanna see something? I'll show you a little something! (MIMICKING MONKEY) Oh, great.
I can see the next headline now.
"Hannah Dates Monkey Boy!" Hey, there wouldn't even be any headlines if it wasn't for you.
And there wouldn't be any picture if you hadn't locked me out.
Clear it! Out of my way! This is my house! Get back! Hey, why don't y'all go chase a crooked politician? At least he'll smile for you.
So, when exactly were you two gonna tell me you were dating? Come on, Dad, it's not funny.
It's horrible.
Yeah, how could anybody believe that I would go out with someone like her? Jackson, it would be the luckiest day of your life if you got to date Hannah Montana.
And what am I saying? Well, the two of you do make a lovely couple.
No! This is all your fault! "Don't bother switching the limos.
Nobody's following us.
I am so smart.
" Blah! Blah! Blah! - Is that true, Mile? - Dad, please, no lectures.
The entire world now thinks I'm dating Jackson.
Isn't that punishment enough? I'm afraid this time you're not gonna able to joke your way out of this.
Who's joking? (CELL PHONE RINGING) Oh, great, just what I need.
Hi, Traci.
Hannah, I can't believe you have a boyfriend and didn't tell me.
And he's so cute.
Yeah, he's really something.
You have to bring him to the party I'm throwing for Madonna tomorrow afternoon.
Everyone's going to be there.
It's the perfect place to show off Hannah's new hottie.
Trace, I don't know how we could pass up an opportunity like this.
Of course me and my hottie will be at your party.
What? Fabu.
Ciao.
Will this nightmare never end? Not until the press gets a picture of us breaking up.
And that party is the perfect place to do it.
Look, I am not going to some stupid celebrity party as Hannah's little show dog.
Right, Dad? Dad? Oh, no, Dad! Why? Son, I know your sister got herself into this pickle, but she's not gonna be able to get out of it without your help.
Now, you may not like it, but that's what family does for family.
All right, fine.
But since you got me into this, I get to break up with you.
No way.
I'm the teen pop sensation.
I get to break up with you.
Right, Dad? Dad? (WHINING) Oh, no, Dad! Why? Boy, life sure can be weird.
Who would have thought Miley would be dating Jackson and you'd be burping a sack of flour.
Oliver, the assignment is to raise a fake baby.
You don't get extra credit for turning into Daddy McDork.
Hey, when you take Mr.
Meyer's class next semester, you can handle the assignment any way you want.
- But I'm gonna take it seriously.
- Why? There's my little cuddle-wuddles.
Mommy got you some organic strained beets from a non-profit Native American commune.
(EXCLAIMS) Yummy! You missed it, Sarah, sweetheart.
He just learned how to sit up on his own.
Good for you! It won't be long until you're all grown up and making alternative fuel out of raisins.
So, that's what this is all about.
- What? - Nothing.
It's just that you and Sarah and your "flour child" make a very cute family.
- Thank you.
- Oh, Lilly.
You kidder.
We're just friends doing an assignment.
Nothing more.
Don't blow this for me.
- I really like her.
- (GIGGLING) Since when? Since she became the mother of my assignment.
Look, I can't explain it.
But the more time I spend with her, the more I like her.
Oliver, I'm worried.
I think he looks a little pale.
Of course he's pale, he's bleached flour.
Okay, so we're clear on the plan, right? We get in front of the press and I say, " Jackson, what are you trying to say to me?" - And you say - "See you.
Wouldn't wanna be you.
" Now where's the free shrimp? Jackson, you're breaking up with Hannah Montana.
Can't you do it with a little more class? (BURPING) Apparently not.
Look who came to wish you a happy birthday, Madonna.
America's new sweethearts.
Madonna's a cat? (MADONNA MEOWING) I'm at a birthday party in a tent for a cat.
What's for dessert, chocolate mousse or chocolate mouse? (GIGGLING) You're funny.
And he's even cuter in person.
He is? I mean he is, of course, he is.
After all, he's my boyfriend.
Impressive.
Madonna's purring.
Oh, wait, that's me.
(LAUGHS) (SNIFFING) I smell something wrapped in bacon.
What a caveman! You better be careful, someone's going to steal him.
Make me an offer.
You're Hannah's new dude.
- Awesome.
- Yeah, great, whatever.
Hey, I'm Stavros.
I'm dating Ashley.
- Which Ashley? - Like it matters.
(SIGHING) I got courtside seats for the Lakers tomorrow night and Leonardo, he can't go.
You wanna come? Do I have to pay for parking? Hey, you're one of us now.
We don't have to pay for anything.
So, what do you mean? Dude, when you're in the public eye as much as we are, companies give you stuff just for the publicity.
Here.
Get your picture taken wearing these, you'll be getting tons of glasses for free.
Awesome.
Oh, yeah.
(GASPS) Look, Hannah, someone got Madonna a rhinestone scooper.
(MILEY LAUGHS) What a lucky kitty.
- Where's the press? - Don't worry.
I knew you'd want your privacy, so I kept the whole thing on the DL.
Terrific.
Isn't that woman wearing the same dress as you? (GASPS) Oh, she has got to go.
Security, escort my mother out! (MIMICKING TRACl) Yes, This Week In Hollywood? Hi, it's Traci Van Horne and you'll never guess who's at my party.
Hannah Montana and her new beau.
That's right.
And you better hurry.
Ciao.
(PANTING) Oliver, you've got to get your board.
The waves are incredible today.
(BLOWING AIR) How did I get so lucky? Everyone picked partners and you were the only two left.
Ollie-kins, where's the sunscreen? Now that they've destroyed the ozone layer, we have to protect Little Ollie.
Coming, Sarah-boo.
(GIGGLING) Ollie-kins? Sarah-boo? I know.
My cup runneth over.
Oh, there you go.
Just think, one day he could be a great humanitarian.
Or a couple dozen cupcakes.
So, is he a good kisser? (EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) We haven't done that yet.
We're taking it slow.
Real slow.
I'm talking centuries.
Hannah, train wreck.
Someone tipped off the press that you were here.
- No.
- I'm so embarrassed.
- I'll sneak you out the back.
- No, that would ruin everything! I mean, if we don't face them now, they'll never go away.
You are so brave.
(CAR BRAKES SCREECHING) (STAVROS WHOOPING) Oh, yeah! Jackson, where've you been? Stavros just let me drive his Vavetti Convertible.
It was awesome! Hey, why don't you keep it for the week? I got an SUV that needs some TLC.
Oh, yeah! Honey.
- Chicks.
What? - The press is here.
So if there's anything you would like to tell me, you should tell me now.
- Oh, right.
- Come on, Jackson.
- What do you have to say to me? - I Come on.
I can handle it.
Say something, monkey boy.
I love you Hannah Montana and I never want to break up with you.
Never, ever! Well, aren't you full of surprises, honey? - Come on, Miles.
What's the big deal? - Don't even talk to me! Sounds like you two are still a couple.
Not just any couple! According to Jackson, we're the happiest couple in Hollywood! Jackson, I'm gonna ask you a question I've never had to ask one of my kids before.
Why didn't you break up with your sister? All right, look, I admit it.
I may have gotten a little carried away.
But, Dad, some guy loaned me his convertible for the week just because I'm Hannah's boyfriend.
I don't care what the reason was, you were supposed to help your sister It's the Vavetti twin turbo.
You and I are gonna take a long ride and talk about it.
I'll drive.
Dad, what about me? Oh, honey, there's no backseat and you've already had a ride.
- Do you hear yourself? - Oh, I'm sorry.
Your daddy just had little bit of a male moment there.
Jackson, your sister's right.
You can't take advantage of her like this.
She's the one that made me her boyfriend in the first place.
All I'm asking is to keep pretending for, like, a week, so I can have a little fun with it.
And you can't even give me that.
- Good! We understand each other.
- Yeah, we do.
When you need a favor from me, that's family helping family.
But when I ask for a little something in return, well, suddenly Hannah doesn't play that game.
Nice to know how things work around here! Don't worry, honey, he'll cool off.
I know, it's just What? Well, I did get him into this, and he did help me out.
And he never really gets the perks I get when I'm Hannah.
I mean, really, where's the harm? I don't know, but I'm sure the two of you will find it.
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think I have to do it.
- One week.
I can handle that.
Yes! (WHOOPS) You are the best girlfriend I've ever had! This is weirder than a three-eyed billy goat in a flat-bed truck in the middle of Manhattan.
Okay, Coop, I'll tell him.
So, how was lunch with the boyfriend? - We didn't eat.
- Why not? No, no, no, you listen to me, Mr.
Diddy.
If you want us to eat at your restaurant again, it's table one or nothing.
Yeah, I don't even care if you have to dump Bradgelina.
You're dealing with Jacksannah now.
Good day.
I said good day, Diddy! - Answer your question? - Hey, Jacksannah, Cooper called.
Remember him, your best friend? Oh, right, I've been meaning to get back to him.
Note to self.
Send Coop a nice fruit basket saying I'm sorry, blah, blah, blah.
And throw in an autographed photo of Jacksannah.
That's it! I've had it! Look at yourself! I don't even know who you are anymore.
And tomorrow on the Wake Up, It's Wendy! show, I'm announcing that " Jacksannah" is history.
Hold on, you can't do that.
We had a deal.
And if I'm not seen in public wearing the sunglasses, the jacket, and the watch, I'm gonna have to give them all back! I don't care! But the public doesn't want me, they want us.
I'm nothing without you.
You complete me.
And you completely creep me out! Okay, okay, okay, okay! But what about family helping family? I tried to help you, but all it's done is turn you into an obnoxious, self-centered jerk who took advantage of his sister and blew off his best friend! Dude, it's over! Snoop Dorky Dork.
Hey, hey, I did not blow him off! I'm sending him a nice fruit basket! Dad, talk to her.
(CAR ENGINE STARTING) Dad! (ROBBIE WHOOPING) I am gonna send you a very strongly worded text message.
So, how about that A we got on the baby project? Yeah.
It's pretty great.
(CLEARS THROAT) - Did you say something? - No.
Oh.
- I'm just gonna go stretch my legs.
- All right.
She's suffocating me! Sarah? The love of your life? The apple of your eye? The mother of your flour? That's just it.
Without the kid we have nothing to talk about.
So tell her how you feel and get it over with.
Lilly, you don't understand, I mean, that would break her heart.
I'm her Big Daddy Oken! Big Daddy.
I gotta be honest.
Without the baby we have nothing to talk about, you're boring and you use petroleum-based hair products.
It's over.
Bye, Lilly! She's dying inside.
(SINGING) If we were a movie You'd be the right guy I'd be the best friend That you'd fall in love with In the end we'd be laughing Watching the sunset Fade to black, show the names Play that happy song (AUDIENCE CHEERING) What a beautiful, beautiful song, sung by a beautiful, beautiful girl.
(WHOOPS) Take a look under your seats people.
You've all got free Hannah Montana goodie bags! (WHOOPS) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) So, Hannah.
Whenever I hear a song sung with that kind of emotion, I can't help thinking that you were thinking of someone very special.
Am I right? Am I right? I'm right, aren't I? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) - Well, now that you bring it up - Yes.
I do have some news about me and Jackson.
(AUDIENCE WHOOPING) No, no, no, it's not like that.
It's really kind of serious.
(ALL EXCLAIMING) The truth is, Jackson and I are Totally and completely in love! (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Oh, no.
- I love Hannah Montana! I love Hannah Montana! I love Hannah Montana! Ladies and gentlemen, the couple of the moment, Jacksannah! - What are you doing? - I am trying to save this relationship! - What relationship? - Don't say that, babe.
I love this woman.
I love this woman.
I love her more than I love my Grunschwiegenflagen watch! Water resistant to 150 meters.
Wow, Hannah, what do you have to say to that? - You wanna know what I'm gonna say? - Yes, yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! You make me sick.
I hate everything that you've become.
We never should've started this dating thing.
It was one big, huge mistake, but now it's over.
No, no.
No, I can change.
Please, just give me another chance.
I don't want to lose you and all the things, Grunschwiegenflagen watch, that we have together.
Forget it.
We have nothing together.
Jackson, it's over.
(ALL EXCLAIMING) Hannah, he's down on his knees.
How can you turn him down? Watch me.
(SINGING) If we were a movie I'd be the right guy That you'd fall in love with Look at yourself.
You're pathetic.
(AUDIENCE BOOING) No, stop, please! You don't understand! Jackson! Jackson! - Thanks a lot.
Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! - Wait.
Hold on, everybody.
- Jackson! Jackson! I've got something I gotta say.
Hannah's not the bad guy here.
I am.
I just I wanted a taste of the good life and Hannah pretended to go out with me so I could get it.
The truth is, there never really was a Jacksannah.
(ALL EXCLAIMING) So you're saying all of this was pretend? No, not all of it.
I do love Hannah, but more like a sister.
And I was hoping that we could get back to that.
I really am sorry.
Okay.
(EXCLAIMING IN DELIGHT) Hug, hug.
Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Stop pointing at the watch.
- Sorry.

(SINGING) We haven't met, and that's okay 'Cause you will be asking for me one day (POLICE SIREN WAILING) (TIRESS CREECHING) (IMITATING EDWARD G.
ROBINSON) You'll never take me alive, coppers! (EXCLAIMS) (SINGING) Don't want to wait in line The moment is mine, believe me (CAR HORN BLARING) Out of the way, Grandma, got the po-po on my tail.
Jackson, I'm trying to rehearse for the American Teen Music Awards.
Yeah.
Yeah, don't worry, you're not bothering me.
- But you're bothering me.
- Oh, right.
Don't care.
Look out, cow! (TIRESS CREECHING) (COW MOOING) Look at that heifer fly.
Right into the marching band! (MARCHING BAND PLAYING) (CRASHING) Hey, Jackson, you know, you have a real car.
Here's a thought.
Get in it and drive away.
Well, I would if I had real gas, which costs real money which Rico doesn't pay me a real lot of.
Ask Rico for a raise.
(IN COUNTRY ACCENT) Ask for a raise.
Gee, that sounds like a good idea.
Oh, wait.
I did.
It's not gonna happen.
Rico's vicious, ruthless and completely inflexible.
(TANGO MUSIC PLAYING) He looks pretty flexible to me.
(GROANS) To me, he looks like a very lonely munchkin.
Well, Jackson can't leave the house unless that munchkin gives him a raise.
Then maybe finally, I can get some rehearsing done.
Wish me luck.
(IMITATING MUNCHKIN) Remember, follow the yellow brick road.
Hey, Rico, that is one lucky broom.
Can it, toots.
I'm working on my tango.
- Have you gotten taller? - Your brother's not getting a raise.
I wasn't going to say that.
- Okay, fine, I was.
But - All right, I'll make you a deal, honey.
I'll ask my dad to give him a raise, if you'll be my dance partner for my ballroom dance competition.
- (LAUGHING) Ballroom dancing? - Laugh all you want.
Chicks dig it.
And I dig chicks.
So, what do you say? You wash my back, I wash your brother's.
Okay, first (EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) And second, I think it's "scratch my back.
" And third (EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) Fine.
No dance partner, no raise.
Okay, fine, then no more smiley Miley.
Listen here, bub, my brother's sick of being pushed around by you, and he ain't gonna work here anymore unless you give him a raise.
- Okay, okay, you win.
- I do? Yeah.
He's fired.
Really? (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that It's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Hey, Jackson, where you going? Well, I was heading to Jessica Alba's for movies and kettle corn, but then I decided I'd rather spend six hours making minimum wage at Rico's.
(STAMMERING) Wait, wait.
You know what? I've been thinking.
And you are right.
That little runt doesn't pay you enough.
I think you should quit.
- I'm not gonna quit.
- You're right! He isn't worth your time or trouble.
I'll quit for you.
- Miley - No need to thank me, brother.
That's why we're here.
Miles? What did you do? Well See, I may have asked Rico to give you a raise, and it may have not gone as well as I'd hoped.
Oh, great, what did that little weasel do? Cut back my hours? Just a tad.
Don't worry, Jackson, as soon as Rico sees how dead this place is without you he'll beg for you to come back.
Or not.
What happened? How did it get so busy? Simple.
I brought in a professional.
Here you are.
Two fresh waters for miladies.
I gotta tell you, getting rid of this piece of seaweed was the best thing I ever did.
Look, Rico, I want my job back.
Again with the lifting! Look, I'm sorry, this wasn't my fault.
He's right.
It was mine.
There's got to be something I can do.
Hey, do you still need a dance partner? Too late, angel face.
This is Carmen.
She's from Argentina.
Land of Tango.
(IMITATING RICO) Great.
Thanks to you, I'm from Flatbroke, the land of unemployment.
(ROBBIE WHOOPS) Oh, yeah.
Man, this jalopy races faster than Uncle Earl's heart at a Shakira concert! - I can't believe this! - I'm not playing it.
I'm just making sure it's age appropriate like any good parent should.
- Jackson, I'm sorry.
- Sorry doesn't pay the bills, sister.
No, that would be me.
Somebody want to tell me what's going on here? - I just got fired.
- Oh, no, Jackson.
- What did you do? - I didn't do anything.
- You did.
- Me? Yeah, you had to have a second kid, and now little miss bigmouth just got me fired.
- Is that true, Mile? - Dad, I was just trying to help.
And besides, Jackson, I said I was sorry.
What else do you want from me? I don't know A job? I'm a kid! How am I supposed to get you a job? Unless you want to be like (LAUGHING) Hannah Montana's assistant or something.
- I'll take it.
- What? - The job.
It's perfect.
- No.
No, it's not.
I'm your little, bigmouthed sister.
You don't want to be my assistant.
You're right.
Assistant is demeaning.
Let's go with Senior Vice President in charge of Assistication.
I'll start tomorrow at 9:00.
Wait, better make that 10:00.
I gotta get me some business cards made.
(TIRESS CREECHING) What just happened? I just hit an armadillo, and Hannah just got herself a new Senior Vice President of Assistication.
But I don't need an assisticant! Well, you should've thought of that before you offered him the job.
- This is a horrible idea.
- Yeah.
Probably is.
Guess you better get up there and fire him.
Dad, I can't! I already cost him one job today, I can't fire him from another.
That would be awful.
You do it.
Oh, no.
You made this mess, you gotta go up there and clean it up.
But, Daddy, I can't.
- That's the deal, bud.
- Okay.
Okay, fine.
I'm gonna go up there and tell him.
I can be strong.
I'm gonna go up there and say Daddy, please, help me, bail me out.
Do I always have to learn something? Honey, I'm just trying to teach you how to be a mature adult.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I got a po-po roadblock in front of me and an army of evil turkeys on my tail.
(POLICE SIREN WAILING) Jackson, come on, where's the limo? We're gonna be late for the CD signing! Chillax.
I'm on it right now, boss! Wow, Jackson is your assistant.
This is a horrible idea.
I'm talking your dad's old mullet horrible.
Lilly.
I know.
"It was a different time, the chicks dug it.
" Lilly, stop.
Right.
We were talking about you hiring Jackson.
Horrible, horrible, horrible.
Lilly, I'm trying to give Jackson a chance.
I mean, it's the least I can do.
And besides, I could use a little support here.
You're right.
You're being a very good sister.
And who knows, maybe he'll rise to the occasion.
Do you really believe that? Do you want support or the truth? Make up your mind.
No.
No.
No.
This is absolutely unacceptable, all right? And I can tell you that Hannah Montana will never use your limo company again.
Good day, sir.
I said good day! - Jackson, what happened? - They don't have a limo.
And they're saying it's my fault because I didn't make a reservation.
Can you believe that? I know I do.
You didn't make a reservation? Miles, the company's called "Ready When You Are Limos" not "Ready When You Are Limos If You Make A Reservation.
" I think it's pretty clear who's at fault here.
- (MOUTHING) Horrible.
- Zip it.
- Jackson, what am I gonna do now? - Look, it's not a problem.
I'll just drive you to the CD signing in my car.
Just sit in the back, close your eyes, it'll feel just like a limo.
Again, really sorry about the whole convertible top thing.
Hi, everybody.
You have a little something in your teeth.
(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) It's a fly.
(BOTH EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) Nasty.
(TANGO MUSIC PLAYING) (YELPING) Come on, mamacita.
No pain, no gain.
Here you are, ladies.
My newest concoction, the Smokin' Oken Smoothie.
Cool enough for the hottest babes on the beach.
Excuse me.
Coming through.
Knew him when he was a dork.
What's crack-a-lackin', Lilay? What is wrong with you? Face it, Lilly.
I found my new thang.
And I'm working it.
Well, work your way over and get me two bottles of water.
Two bizzles of wizzle for the Lizzle.
I'm going to bizzle you if you don't knock that off.
Don't be a playa hater, skater! Ha! You mizzled.
(SCREAMING) Ay, papi.
- Stop whining, Carmen! Just pop your shoulder back in and let's rumba.
Come on, Jackson, answer your phone.
(CELL PHONE RINGING) I can hear it ringing.
(RINGING CONTINUES) Why can I hear it ringing? That's why.
(IN COUNTRY ACCENT) Why, hello there.
You've reached Jackson, Hannah Montana's assisticant.
I can't do any assisticating right now 'cause I forgot my phone.
(MOCK LAUGHTER) - Stupid Jackson! - What'd he do now? Oh, he picked up Hannah's dry cleaning.
- What's wrong with that? - Then he dropped it in the parking lot.
- Horrible! - Stop saying that.
I have to perform at the American Teen Music Awards tonight, and all I can think about is Jackson getting me there late, or bringing the wrong wig, or clogging up the green room toilet and blaming it on the Dixie Chicks.
- Why don't you just fire him? - I know, I have to.
And I will.
First thing tomorrow.
- Miley - All right, fine.
You're right.
As soon as he walks in that door, I'm gonna say, " Jackson, you are " - Carrying a balloon heart bouquet.
- Yeah.
Look, I just wanted to say that I know I screwed up a few times this week.
And anybody else probably would've let me go, but you didn't.
And that means a lot to me.
So, thanks.
Wow, Jackson, you got me earrings.
- He got me earrings.
- Oh, no.
They're beautiful.
I know.
It's horrible.
And I don't even care how many paychecks it takes me to pay them off, it's worth it.
- Just to know that you believe in me.
- Uh-huh.
I do.
You betcha.
Well, I'm just gonna go double check on that limo for tomorrow night's awards show.
- It's tonight.
- Yeah.
I'm all over it.
How can I fire him after this? Too bad you can't give him some stupid job at the awards show, so when he screws up, it doesn't matter.
Oh, come on, Lilly, that's just brilliant! I know.
ANNOUNCER ON PA: Hannah Montana rehearsal.
Take one.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (SINGING) We haven't met, and that's okay 'Cause you will be asking for me one day Don't want to wait in line The moment is mine, believe me Don't close your eyes 'Cause it's a chance worth takin' And I think that I can shake you I know where I stand I know who I am I would never run away when life gets bad It's everything I see Every part of me Gonna get what I deserve I got nerve Electrified, I'm on a wire Getting together and we're on fire What I said you heard Now I got you spinning And don't close your mind The words I use are open And I think that I can show you Okay.
That's enough.
- Great rehearsal, Sean.
- You too, Hannah.
Take ten.
You deserve it.
So do I.
Great job.
Come on down.
Hey.
So, what else do you need me to do, boss? You want me to check the sound board? Inspect the trap doors? Make sure none of those big heavy lights come crashing down, - during your number? - No, no, no.
Get away from the trap doors, and stay away from the lights, and Well, stay away from everything.
Everything.
- So what am I supposed to do? - I've got a very special job for you.
It's the only thing I need you to do today.
Nothing else.
Just this.
Everything else, once again, stay away.
- Bring it.
- Okay.
I want you to go to every single member of the crew and tell them how much I appreciate their hard work.
That's it? That doesn't seem like a very important job.
Oh, no, no.
Trust me, it's important.
Good will makes for a good set.
Good set makes for a good show.
And a good show makes for a happy pop star.
Okay.
Oh, and if you finish, go around again! And again! And again! Spread the love! You know, sooner or later, you're gonna have to face the music and fire him.
No, no, no.
Not anymore, I found an easy fix for this.
I found out a way to utilize Jackson to the best of his abilities.
By giving him jobs to do that he can't screw up? Exactly.
You tell Hannah Montana I love her, too.
Whatever you say.
Please put me down.
(GROANS) So keep up the good work and remember, Hannah loves you.
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN) You got a kink in your neck? - You want me to fix that for you? - You can do that? Yeah, sure.
No problem.
Just turn around, relax, and (BACK CRACKING) I didn't do it! My back! - What you do? - I don't know.
It worked when Scooby did it to Shaggy! - That's a cartoon! - No, I was talking about my cousins.
- Look, just try to walk it off.
- Yeah, I would, if I could walk.
Man, I can't dance like this.
- I gotta go tell Hannah.
- No, no, no! What you need to do is you need to find someplace to go lie down.
Out of sight.
- Where no one can find you.
- No.
But Hannah said that No.
Don't worry, I'll tell Hannah everything she needs to know.
Mmm-mmm.
She should hear it from me.
I mean, you said we're friends right? - No, she hates you.
- What? Yeah, yeah, yeah, the whole appreciation thing? It was my idea.
You should probably just go.
Go on, git.
Put a little ice on that.
And heat.
Ice then heat.
Stretch.
Hey.
Hannah loves you.
Hannah loves you.
You're her favorite Sweeper guy.
ANNOUNCER ON PA: And now performing her new hit, I Got Nerve, teen pop sensation, Hannah Montana! (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (SINGING) We haven't met, and that's okay 'Cause you will be asking for me one day Don't want to wait in line The moment is mine, believe me Don't close your eyes 'Cause it's a chance worth takin' And I think that I can shake you I know where I stand I know who I am I would never run away when life gets bad It's everything I see Every part of me Gonna get what I deserve I got nerve - Get out.
- It's going good.
(SINGING) Electrified, I'm on a wire Getting together and we're on fire What I said you heard Now I got you spinning Don't close your eyes The words I use are open And I think that I can Jackson! - I'm fired, aren't I? - Ya think? What's the matter with you, Son? You didn't even try to miss the one-legged chicken.
And he's just hopping in one place.
Who cares? I'll probably just mess it up like I messed up being Hannah's assisticant.
First of all, "assisticant" ain't a word.
And second, don't be down just because things didn't work out with you and your sister.
It doesn't mean you're gonna mess up everything.
- You did great down at Rico's.
- I know, and I liked it, too.
Well, maybe that's why you were good at it.
It doesn't matter anymore.
I'll never get that job back.
Daddy, I feel awful.
I opened my big mouth and got him fired, then opened it and got him hired, and then fired again.
Maybe I should just keep my big mouth shut.
Oh, honey, let's face it.
You'll never be able to keep that big mouth shut.
(STAMMERS) I know! It's okay, bud.
Just remember, next time before you say something, just think it through.
You're right.
Wait a minute, I think I know how to fix this.
- Now, slow down, bud.
- Right again.
Let me really think it through before I open my big mouth this time.
Yep, that'll work! Let's go! I know how to get Jackson's job back at Rico's.
- How are you going to do that? - Easy.
I just gotta make a deal with the little devil.
(TANGO MUSIC PLAYING) Now that's how you dip, ya dip.
Look at that.
No style.
No presentation.
No flair.
I can't believe I lost my job to him.
That'll be $3, milady.

Mmm.
Nothing better on a peanut butter sandwich than pickle chips, a little bit of mustard and chili.
What? It all ends up in the same place.
Here she comes! Here she comes! It's The Cracker! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) That's the new girl.
Why do they call her The Cracker? Watch.
(CRACKING) Even from here it hurts.
Rumor is, when her old school kicked her out, they had to call animal control.
It took six dogcatchers and a giant net to bring her down.
Come on, Lilly, it's hard enough to be the new kid in school without people making up stories about you.
Remember when I moved here from Tennessee and somebody spread a rumor that I ate possum? I didn't know you then.
I bet she's a nice kid.
With freakishly strong hands.
Come on, guys, I say we all go and say hi.
What do you know, she might surprise us.
And even if she is a bully, it's not like she is going to pull anything with Mrs.
Rush here.
Yeah, eyes like a hawk.
Tell you what, you go make friends with The Cracker and I'll stay here and start writing your will.
Put me down for all her shoes.
I mean, good luck.
The fellowship of the wienies.
Hi.
I'm Miley.
You know, I used to be new here, too.
But now I'm old here.
Well, not old-old, like this meatloaf.
(LAUGHING) (CRACKING) Neat trick.
You know, I saw The Nutcracker once.
(GIGGLING) Loved it.
- Got any lipstick? - Sure.
Yeah.
This color will look great on you.
I can tell we're gonna be good friends.
Call animal control.
(CRACKLING) She's behind me, isn't she? (CRACKLING) Anybody got a net? (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Now, Robbie Ray, you and Jackson enjoy that father-son fishing trip.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) I won't let anything harm a hair on your baby girl's pretty little head.
Gotta go.
- Who did this to you? - The new kid in school.
She thinks I look better with my hair up.
Didn't anybody try to help you? That would be me.
I can't believe this.
All I was doing was trying to be nice and now I'm a big old target.
Yeah, and thanks to you, so am I.
If I'd only believed that possum story, my life would be a lot simpler.
First thing tomorrow, you go right to that principal and you tell him what's going on.
And be a snitch? No way! Well, then it looks like I'm gonna have to go down there and protect you myself from The Cookie.
She's not The Cookie, she's The Cracker.
I don't care what kind of snack food she is, she's gonna have to get through me.
But, Roxy, at school I'm Miley, not Hannah.
I can't use my bodyguard to fight my battles.
Can't you just teach me some of your special moves? Oh, you mean like this? (EXCLAIMING) What's so special about that? That's right.
Roxy's like a puma.
And this kitty's got claws.
(HISSING) - Can you teach me that? - No way.
- You only use violence as a last resort.
- And when is that? When she yanks out my intestines and wears it as a belt? Okay, okay, I got a move that'll work for you.
Lilly, you be the bully and I'll be Miley.
Now, get all up in my grill.
I'd rather not.
Come on, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Now, here I am, walking in the halls with blue eyes, all perky.
Come on, girl, show me what you got.
Hey, Miley, give me your lipstick.
(SCREAMS) Principal! Principal! Help me! Help me! That's how you handle a bully.
- You want me to run away? - Like a free range chicken.
(CLUCKING) I can't believe Roxy wouldn't show you some moves.
Just the way she puma'd that pineapple would've scared the juice out of me.
That's just it.
Lilly, I don't have to be a puma.
I just have to make The Cracker think I'm one.
Lilly likey.
(EXCLAIMS) Ow! Well, I'm sorry about your fishing trip.
But that is why they call them freak storms 'cause they're freaky.
Could you open the door? You know, you boys are lucky I'm still open.
The Health department wanted to close me down last week.
- Really? Why was that? - Oh, bugs.
Big, big bugs.
But don't worry, we're fumigating all the other rooms.
'Cause you already did this one? Okay.
Welcome to the honeymoon suite.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
You know, it's kind of funny, when I pictured my honeymoon, it didn't include the big heart-shaped bed or the red satin wallpaper or my dad! Well, it's better than having your mother-in-law along.
Boy! That was a nightmare.
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll get Franklin to bring you boys some fresh towelettes.
- You mean towels.
- Okay.
- I wanna go home.
- Oh, come on, Jackson.
The whole point of this trip was to have a little father-son bonding time.
So we've hit a bump in the road.
Why don't we just look at it as an adventure? Okay, I really wanna go home.
Oh, it's not that bad.
Matter of fact, it kind of reminds me of poker night in Uncle Earl's RV.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) It's Franklin with your towelettes! Remember, it's still an adventure, it's just an adventure with a puppet.
You two in the honeymoon suite? Awkward! (LAUGHING) Franklin, how many times have I told you not to tease the guests? That is no way to get repeat business.
Enjoy your stay.
We are sleeping in shifts.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (EXCLAIMING) That's right.
Miley like a puma.
Yeah, she a bad puma! You better run, Cracker! Go ahead, start running! Why isn't she running? (CRACKING) I'm warning you, Miley like a puma.
Miley like a puma.
Miley run like a puma.
Dad, stop.
Dad, stop tickling my feet.
What are you talking about, Son? I'm over here.
(SCREAMING) Bugs! Bugs! Bugs! We are so getting out of here.
Not without your deluxe complimentary breakfast.
Thank you, but we're not gonna be needing any of that yummy looking breakfast.
We're gonna go ahead and see if we can't salvage what's left of this fishing trip.
Oh, I don't think that's gonna happen today.
The roads are still snowed in.
Looks to me like you're stuck.
(LAUGHS) (THUDDING) (EXCLAIMS) What do you know about that? Looks like we're all stuck.
(LAUGHS) He's right.
We are stuck.
Well, on the bright side, at least he doesn't have the dummy.
Who you calling a dummy, dummy? Dad, I've seen this movie before, and you and I don't make it to the sequel.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (CRACKING) (GROANING) - Talk about a hairy situation.
- (LAUGHING) Don't make me laugh.
Run for your lives! She's coming! Danny, calm down, you're flaking up the hall.
Yeah, she's in the cafeteria.
Not The Cracker.
There's a new girl in school.
She's even scarier! Where is she? Where's The Cracker? Wait a minute, that sounds like Oh, no.
What up, girls? Where do I park my board? Roxy, what are you doing here? - And why are you dressed like a kid? - Quiet, I'm trying to blend in.
What're you all looking at? I got held back a grade or two.
Who's counting? Not me.
That's why I got held back.
Roxy, we need to talk in private.
- Follow me.
- Follow me.
(SCREAMING) - Let's just back up.
- Okay.
Just go about your business.
Nothing to see here you can't see at the circus.
Roxy, you can't be here.
You said you weren't going to the principal, and you're not wearing your running shoes.
Well, if you won't protect yourself, Roxy will.
Now stand still.
It's time to pick this problem apart.
Turn around.
- Wow, your hair looks great.
- You, too, I love the braid.
That's my signature.
Float like a butterfly, braid with a bead.
Now, come on, this puma's hungry for some Cracker.
You're sitting in my seat.
(CRACKING) - I don't think so.
- Cute.
Can you do this? I'm not scared of you.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Yeah, that's right.
Your bullying days are over.
Because she's the big cheese and the cheese always covers the cracker.
- What did you do? - I used ESP.
Extra Sensory Puma.
We're never gonna get out.
- We're gonna die in here.
- No one is gonna die.
Now stop focusing on the negative and focus on the positive.
Snowplow's gonna be here soon.
Bad news, fellas.
Plow won't be here till morning.
Sweet frozen niblets.
I wanna live! I wanna live! I want to live! (GROANS) We gotta at least try to dig out again.
Right? With what? You broke all of our best plastic spoons.
Oh, please, he stole all that stuff from Madam Fu's.
- Madam who's? - Madam Fu's.
- Madam who's - Okay, forget it! Who needs spoons? I'm gonna ram it.
Well, see you on the other side, old man.
(YELLING) (THUDS) I can't feel my lips.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Don't even think about it.
In fact, don't even think about thinking about it.
Yeah, you heard her.
Flake off! Oh, yeah.
Life at school just got a whole lot better.
Tell me about it.
Look who's coming this way.
It's Troy McCann.
He's so cute.
- Hey, Lilly.
Hey, Miley.
- Hi, Troy.
Listen, the basketball team is having a party this Saturday, and I was wondering if you guys wanna go.
- No, we can't.
- Actually, I I said no! Now, move, move, move! He seems like a sweet boy.
Those the ones you gotta watch.
Roxy, what are you doing? I had my eyes on him.
Never realized how many dangers lurk in these halls.
Bullies, boys, and that chicken potpie they served today? That was nasty.
From now on, we are brown bagging it.
You're not thinking of staying, are you, Roxy? I have to.
If I leave, The Cracker's gonna go back to cracking.
And since you won't go to the principal, I gotta be here to protect you.
Now, take your shoes off and put these on.
Roxy, these look like nurse's shoes.
Safest shoes ever made.
These waxy floors are a broken hip waiting to happen.
- Nurse's shoes? - Hey, well, look on the bright side.
I'm sorry, there is no bright side to this.
(SNORING) (MAN SPEAKING SPANISH ON TV) (WOMAN SPEAKING SPANISH ON TV) Poor Pablo.
Oh, she's breaking his heart.
Why do they always go for the bad hombres? Hey, Dad.
Look at us.
We're bonding.
You're right, Son.
And now that we have, let's get the heck out of here.
- I'd love to but where's the snowplow? - There is no snowplow.
- Gunther? - No, it's Franklin.
Gunther's asleep.
(WHISPERING) Dad, what's happening? Don't worry about it, Son.
He's probably just talking in his sleep.
Oh, good work, Einstein.
Now shut your yapper and listen.
He never did call for a snowplow.
But there's a heater register right behind the night stand.
You can open it and get to your car.
Thank you, thank you so much.
What am I doing? He's right, Jackson.
Come on, we're going home.
Take me with you.
Okay, Dad, I know this is a little weird, but in a strange way, he did save our lives.
Listen to yourself, Son.
He's a doll.
You aren't so bad yourself, cowboy.
Dad, in some part of his brain, Gunther wants us to do this.
But it's stealing, I think.
Just leave 50 bucks on the table.
He got me at a garage sale for 5.
Good enough for me.
(CHUCKLING) Works every time.
- Hey, Miley, I like that outfit.
- So did I.
Until I came downstairs this morning.
What happened this morning? Hey, hey, girlfriend.
She's impossible.
I can't talk to boys, and these nurse's shoes are hideous, and now she's making us wear the same clothes so if I get lost, she can tell people, "I'm looking for someone dressed like me.
" Hey, only four more years and you can wear what you want.
Unless she follows you to college.
Why didn't I tell the principal in the first place? Sure, I would've been a snitch, but I wouldn't have been a snitch with a computer tracking device.
- Say what? - It's in my barrette! Well, it's too late to tell the principal.
Now that Roxy is here, The Cracker isn't bullying anybody anymore.
I'll save you a seat at the cafeteria.
And I'll cut up your lunch into small, safe, non-chokable pieces.
Great.
Wait a minute.
Lilly, what if Roxy wasn't here anymore? The Cracker would bust you like a pi�ata and she'd probably use Dandruff Danny as the stick.
Perfect! Am I missing something? Just meet me in the cafeteria with the principal in five minutes.
But what about Roxy? Hey, Jeanie, this barrette would look perfect in your light brown hair.
Thanks, Miley.
(TRACKING DEVICE BEEPING) Where is that girl going? We don't have gym this period.
LILLY: Okay, I've got the principal and we're coming down the hall right now.
Great.
The fox is on the move.
Wow, somebody thinks a lot of themselves.
It means I'm going in.
Danny, I have some bad news.
Roxy was arm wrestling the principal and accidentally snapped his wrist like a twig.
- He kicked her out of school.
- Roxy got expelled? I'm doomed! Sorry to hear about your friend.
Yeah, I'm helpless now.
(CRACKING) Lilly? Lilly? Mrs.
Rush? (SOBBING) Looks pretty good, but it still needs something.
Oh, yeah, nuts.
(CRACKING) - I'm late, aren't I? - Just a smidge.
(CLEARING THROAT) You did the right thing coming to me, girls.
She's not gonna bother anyone else in the school again.
You have anything to say for yourself, young lady? - Sorry, Stewart.
- That's okay.
All right, Henrietta Laverne.
Let's go.
(GIGGLING) Henrietta Laverne? At least now we know why she's so mean.
Well, thank goodness that's over.
I was running out of fake dangers to protect you from.
Excuse me? Oh, I only did all that stuff to make your life so miserable that you'd go to the principal like you should've done in the first place.
So this was your plan from the beginning? That's right.
You've heard of reverse psychology.
Well, welcome to reverse Roxology.
- No need to thank me, honey.
- Wait a minute.
I got tossed around like a salad so you could teach me a lesson? You never do eat your vegetables.
Well, you better run 'cause Miley like a puma! (SCREAMS) Principal! Principal! Help me! Help me! (SINGING) By day, I play, the part in every way Of simple, sweet, calm and collected How many times have I told you? Stop stealing my stuff.
Jeez! Somebody's a little diva.
Tell me about it.

Well, there you have it, America.
Tonight, we saw Ethan Williams sing his heart out with Shakira and win his own recording contract.
Give him a hand.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Congratulations, Ethan.
We'll see you after the show.
Which means we have to say goodbye to these two adorable kids who really have a fine career ahead of them as long as it doesn't involve singing.
And I mean it, guys.
Not even Happy Birthday.
Next week on Singing With The Stars, three new hopefuls get their shot at a record deal and a chance to sing with this teen pop sensation.
Who is she? Hey, get up Me! Hannah Montana! See you all next week, and we'll really pump up the party! Hey, get up Get loud Start pumpin' up the party now I can't believe you're gonna be the celebrity singer on Singing With The Stars.
That makes Hannah Montana just about the coolest person ever! - Must be you.
- Must be you.
Guys, bad news.
Amber and Ashley's annual Cool List is out again.
Well, that explains it.
How far down did they put us this year? Keep going.
Keep going.
Keep Just skip to the last page.
Oh, we're tied for dead last with Dandruff Danny.
Is someone actually talking to me? Look away, look away! - Okay, see you later.
- Where are you going? Look, I finally cracked the top 100.
And there's no way I'm talking to people from the last page.
Stop begging.
I'll see you after dark.
That boy flip flops more than a catfish in a moon bouncer.
Oh, hey, look, everyone, it's a couple of last page losers in their native habitat.
So sad.
Still eating.
As if they had a reason to live.
Okay, that's it.
Listen.
This list is as bogus as the people who wrote it.
Come on, everyone! Let's show Amber and Ashley that they can't tell us who's cool and who's not! Let's rip up these lists right now! Miley? I'm the only one doing it, aren't I? I'm with you, sister! (GRUNTING) How is he not below us? (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) So, maybe some people care about the list.
But there are plenty of other decent people strong enough to think for themselves, and those are the people I want for my friends anyways.
Like Sarah.
- Hey, Sarah.
- Oh, hi, guys.
Listen, Miley, I'm really sorry but I can't be your lab partner.
Today after school I have to read to the blind, serve punch at the blood drive and hose down cages at the animal shelter.
Wait a minute, you read to the blind yesterday.
I took an extra shift.
Extra shift, my Aunt Petunia! You're just bailing on me because I'm last on Amber and Ashley's list.
- Aren't you? - No, I'm not.
Oh, no, here comes Amber.
Sorry, I'm charitable, not stupid.
Okay, bye.
Great, even Saint Sarah is freezing us out! But, Amber, you have to come to my party.
It'll be a total disaster without you.
Oh, that is so true.
But my mom let me audition for Singing With The Stars and if they have any taste, I'll be singing with Hannah Montana Saturday night.
Okay.
Well, I gotta go to the bathroom.
I haven't looked at myself in like a half hour.
Okay, so maybe we can't get rid of that stupid list, but I can make darn sure that Amber never gets to sing with Hannah Montana.
(SINGING OFF-KE Y) By day, I play the part in every way Of simple, sweet, calm and collected! Or I can make darn sure she does.
You could do that? Sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire.
Amber likes to make fun of people, and I'm gonna make sure she knows what it feels like.
Oh, boy! Once the world hears her sing, she'll be at the bottom of her own stupid list.
Amber sounds like my pet pig, Luann, after she birthed her first batch of piglets.
- I can't believe it.
- I know, she's horrible.
No, I can't believe you had a pet pig named Luann! We thought it was a Lou before the kids came.
(SINGING) If we were a movie I'd be the best friend (OSCAR BARKING) If we were a (OSCAR BARKING) If we We Hey, Dontzig! Could you tell your dog to keep his opinions to hisself? Oh, is Oscar bothering you, Stewart? Yeah! Good boy, Oscar! (OSCAR BARKING) Please make it stop.
(BARKING STOPS) Thank you.
And about what I said in traffic this morning, she cut me off.
Hey, Dad, I finally got that dog to stop barking.
Just took that big T-bone from the fridge and chucked it over the fence.
You mean the one that I dry rubbed, tenderized and marinated for 48 hours? No, the other one? Jackson Rod Stewart! (DOORBELL RINGING) I cook, I clean, I work my fingers to the bone and what's my reward? Hello, Stewarts.
Oscar just wanted to thank you for the T-bone.
Oh, and next time, he'd like a twice-baked potato on the side.
Oh, that's right, baby.
No sour cream, it gives him gas.
(LAUGHING) (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) Sweet niblets, this is worse than the barking dog! (BOTH LAUGHING) - Hey.
What's all this? - Hey.
So, check it out.
I took some of Hannah's concert speakers and I stuck them over in Dontzig's yard.
Next time that little dog barks, he's gonna find out that my woofer's bigger than his.
- You actually think this might work? - There's only one way to find out.
Oh, look, there he is.
(OSCAR BARKING) - Would you like to do the honors? - Don't mind if I do.
(MIMICS DOG BARKING) (OSCAR WHIMPERING) - And that's how the big dog does it.
- Oh, yeah.
Hey, what's that little rat doing now? Hey! Get away from those speakers! Put your leg down.
Put your leg Put your leg down! Well, it may be dark, but at least it's quiet.
(OSCAR BARKING) (DOGS BARKING) Oh, yeah.
Yeah, this is much better.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Cramp! I must've worked out too hard last night.
Y'all just go on without me.
I'm just gonna sit at this random table with these random people till the pain subsides.
I miss you guys! - Listen, Oliver - Don't look at me when you talk.
So, have you heard from the producers yet? Are they actually gonna let Amber be on the show? Hey, how's it going? Just resting a cramp.
If you're not gonna look at us, we're not gonna tell you.
Yeah, and it's really good.
- Oliver! - Okay.
All right.
Not only is she gonna be on the show, guess who gets to give her the good news? Okay, this is so worth it! I know.
I'm just waiting for the right mouthful of pasta salad.
Oh, that's a good one! And send.
Hide me.
(CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hey, Amber, it's Hannah Montana.
Gross! The producers asked me to call you to tell you that you are one of the three lucky people performing with me on Singing With The Stars! Anywho, they'll call you with the deets.
I can't wait to meet you.
Thank you, thank you so much! Oh, don't be silly, you deserve everything you're gonna get.
Bye.
Hey, everybody, I'm gonna be singing with Hannah Montana on Singing With The Stars! Okay, who wants to hear the song I'm gonna sing on the show? (CLATTERING) I think we all do! I know I do! Well, if you insist.
I mean (SINGING) By day, I play the part in every way Of simple, sweet, calm and collected - But she - Her voice - You said - I know But now Then who did you guys hear in the bathroom? (SINGING OFF-KE Y) The other side, the other side The other side of me I thought we had an agreement.
No singing.
Snaps and claps only.
Okay, let's just calm down.
Let's try to find the bright side in this.
- I got nothing.
- Me, neither.
Sweet niblets.
(SINGING) The other side, the other side I want you to see The other side, the other side The other side of me Yeah! That's great, Hannah.
And after that you're gonna hug Amber Addison.
Brian will say something he thinks is funny, try to laugh, it'll be over before you know it.
Don't worry, I'm used to it.
My dad gets all his jokes from bubble gum wrappers.
Yeah, well, that would be a step up for Brian.
Look, this must be where the losers stand.
There's puddle stains from all the drippy nervous sweat.
Lola! Would you please focus! Amber's got a real shot at winning this.
And if she does, that list will be the least of our problems.
- We've got to do something.
- You think? - Whoa, that is so cool.
What is it? - The beginning of the end.
We enter through the smoke, Amber sings great, then you and I are on the bottom of the Cool List till we're seniors.
And I'm talking blue haired, Bingo playing, mitten knitting seniors.
Maybe.
And maybe not.
What are you up to? Remember my exploding volcano disaster at last year's science fair? Mount Saint Lilly? People were blowing lava out of their nose for a week.
Well, if I could do that by accident, imagine what I can do to Amber on purpose.
I'm imagining.
And I'm liking.
What the Hey, Dad.
Say hello to Rocky.
Hey, Rocky, you big, drippy horse, you.
What are you doing in my Malibu dog house? I borrowed him from a friend.
And then I invited Dontzig and his little yapper over to play.
Wait till that little yapper finds out that he's playing lunch.
Yes, he is.
Son, I don't like that yapping little purse puppy anymore than you do, but I don't wanna see him swallowed whole.
Don't worry, Dad.
I've got his leash tied to my wrist.
Rocky's not going anywhere.
(DOORBELL RINGING) Well, as long you're sure it's just gonna scare him, I guess it's worth a shot.
(GROWLING) (BARKING) Oscar, no! - Oh, is little Oscar scared? Not exactly.
(OSCAR BARKING) (ROCKY WHIMPERING) Very thoughtful, Stewart.
Osky needed a little exercise.
- Yeah, well, so do you.
- (SCOFFS) So do you.
- Well, so do you.
- (SCOFFS) So do you.
- (SCOFFS) So do you.
- So do you.
- So do you.
- So do you.
So do you.
Rocky, Rocky.
Heel, heel, heel, heel.
Rocky, whoa.
Heel.
Oh, boy.
Go ahead, primp all you want, Little Miss Cool List.
You're about to have a make-up malfunction people will be downloading forever.
She won't get hurt or anything, right? Just her pride, nationwide.
Nowhere to hide, humilified, sad inside.
Are you done? Just remember, you go through the red and she goes through the green because she's mean like an evil queen.
Now, I'm done.
- How do I look? - Like a star.
I can't believe you're about to sing in front of 30 million people.
And that's just America.
There's Canada and Europe and the Soviet Reunion.
Okay, that is so stupid.
The Soviet Reunion is in Europe.
You know I'm not good in geology.
I'm sorry, Ashley.
I'm just nervous.
Well, don't be.
Forget about the fact that it's live.
Forget that if you screw up, everyone in the whole world will be laughing at you.
Just put that out of your head.
It wasn't in my head.
Until now.
Oops.
My bad.
Have a good show.
Hey, Amber! You all ready for your big number? Hannah, I can't do this.
I can't go out there.
Hey.
Hey.
Everything is gonna be fine as long as you go through the green arch.
I repeat, green arch.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
I'm gonna screw up.
I know I'm gonna screw up.
Listen, sometimes I have these worries, too.
But you know what two words always get me through it? Green arch.
See you out there.
Hey, come on.
Get into position.
It's gonna be a blast.
You don't understand.
- I can't be made fun of again.
- Again? When has anyone ever made fun of you? Well, I know it's hard to believe looking at how beautiful I am now, but when I was a kid, I was the geeky girl with glasses, the one that everyone teased all the time.
Really? How geeky? You wouldn't happen to have any pictures, would you? You know, because then I could feel your pain.
No, I burned them all.
And I'm always afraid it's going to happen again.
So you make fun of people now because of what people did to you when you were a geeky little kid? - Yes.
Yes, I do.
- Well, you shouldn't do that.
Don't you get it? When you fight fire with fire, all you get is a bigger fire.
I know, and now I'm gonna flame out in front of America, Asia and the Soviet Reunion.
- You mean Russia.
- Oh, man, we're on there, too.
Okay, listen.
If I can promise you that you're gonna go out looking great, can you promise me that you're gonna be a better person? And then buy a globe? Yeah.
But could you really make that happen? I can pretty guarantee you that you're gonna come out looking a whole lot better than me.
Places! - Oh, no.
Hey.
You're gonna do fine.
Just Just enter through the red arch.
- But you said green.
- And now I'm saying red.
Just do it before I change my mind.
Hey, remember, better person.
And then a globe.
Sweet niblets.
And now our final contestant from Malibu, California.
Give it up for Amber Addison! (SINGING) By day, I play the part in every way Of simple sweet, calm and collected (EXPLOSION) Pretend, to my friends I'm a chameleon (COUGHING) Can make a girl feel disconnected Feel like a star A super hero Sometimes it's hard to separate Got too much on my plate If you could see the other side of me I'm just like every I may have a used a little too much green.
(COUGHING) You think? I've been thinking about it and you know what, I don't care what anybody else says, you're my real friends and I'm sitting with you.
Hey, how's it going? I just dropped a taquito.
Careful, green bean, you're showing.
That's 'cause somebody didn't make this gunk so easy to get off! Don't blame me, blame science.
What are you gonna do now? Not only did Amber win, she's gonna get a recording contract.
All because you had to be a good person.
I hate when you do that! Guys, don't worry about it, it's all gonna be worth it.
Trust me.
(MIMICS FANFARE) Ashley.
Fine.
Snaps and claps only.
Anyway, as you all know, last night I was the big winner.
But before that happened, I made a promise to myself and to my new best friend, Hannah Montana.
- Still worth it? - Wait for it.
So I'm doing something really drastic to the List.
Wait for it.
Dandruff Danny, you and your flakes are ahead of those flakes.
I'm not at the bottom! In your face! (DANNY EXCLAIMING) Still waiting.
Okay.
Not exactly what I was hoping for, but at least she was being nice to somebody.
That's it? You're not even gonna try to get her back? Come on, it's just a stupid list.
Besides, I learned my lesson.
When you fight fire with fire, you just get burned.
I wish you would have told me that before.
Before what? Well, I kind of arranged a little surprise for Amber.
(EXPLOSION) Ew! Who did this? Come on, y'all, it's not funny.
(GRUNTING) Although, I must say, I do love her in green.
(SINGING) In the end we'd be laughing Watching the sunset fade to black Show the names Play that happy song Finally got that dang dog to hush up, didn't you? - Thank you, Son.
- You're welcome.
Next time, trim the fat.
We've got our figures to worry about.
Don't we, Osky baby? Come on, Osky wants another piece.
Cut faster! 

My time is now.
My perfume is Eau Wow.
Complete the circle.
I've never smelled anything like it before.
Okay, where's that director? Hannah is ready to smell up the place.
Let me smell, let me smell.
Hmm.
It's light, it's subtle.
- It's water.
- What a rip-off! Lola, it's just a prop.
The real one will be here any second.
It has been completely under wraps.
Even I haven't smelled it.
Then how do you know if it's any good? Of course it's good.
It's 50 bucks a bottle! And it completes the circle.
Okay, who are those guys? I think they're the circle.
There's my gorgeous little star.
I'm going to make you look fantastic.
- This is your moment.
- What am I, a plate of grits? Here we go again.
Hannah, darling, I didn't see you there.
When I found out we were going to work together again, all I could say was, "Yeeha.
" - Oh, Liza, you haven't changed a bit.
- Fantastic.
That means the eye-lift is working.
So where's that handsome cowboy daddy of yours? Liza likey.
(SNARLING) - He's in the bathroom.
- Oh! - In Europe.
- Oh.
So, what do you say, you give me that little bottle of liquid magic and we shoot ourselves a commercial? Absolutely.
Make-up! Perfect! I'm ready.
My time is now.
My perfume is Eau Wow.
Complete the circle.
I've never smelled anything (CHOKING) Oh, wow! Cut! (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Hannah, darling, little advertising tidbit.
When selling a product, gagging and retching, big turn off.
Right.
That's why you're the director.
Uh-huh.
- One minute.
- Okay.
Lola, what am I gonna do? This stuff smells horrible.
Really? I like it.
It smells like raspberries.
Raspberries! That's it.
- That's what's been making me sick.
- What's wrong with raspberries? MAN: Time's up! Little Miss Miley Stewart is our new junior pie eating champion! With five raspberry pies in 10 minutes! (CHEERING) I'm a champion, I'm a champion, I'm a champion, I won.
MAN: And now to present the award, the Governor of Tennessee.
Uh-oh.
I've got a funny, coming out of my tummy (RETCHING) That was the last time that Governor ever presented that award, or wore that suit.
Now even a whiff of raspberry makes me sick.
Hey, why don't you just use the fake one? It is only filled with water.
- Lola, you're a genius! - I am, aren't I? Complete the circle.
I've never smelled anything like it before.
And cut! - That was great! That was perfect! - I know, I've done it again.
You and I were brilliant.
- And you're still a plate of grits.
- It doesn't matter.
I'm done with this commercial and I never have to smell that perfume again.
(SNIFFS) You're wearing it, aren't you? No.
Yes.
I like it.
- It doesn't matter.
You can't keep it.
- I won't wear it around you.
- Darn right you won't.
- You're not the boss of me! Hey! Let go.
- You don't look so good.
- I've got a funny coming out of my tummy Everybody, clear.
Miley, it's been a half hour.
If that tomato juice was going to get rid of the smell, it would've worked by now.
You're right.
This is getting ridiculous.
Getting? You passed ridiculous when you took that bath in tuna fish.
Hey, it said it would work on some stink website.
I should've backed out of the commercial the minute I smelled that perfume.
Now I smell worse than Uncle Earl after he was drilling for oil and hit that sewage pipe.
Okay, if I haven't said this before, I don't ever want to meet Uncle Earl.
Uncle Earl's not that bad.
The one you don't wanna meet is Aunt Max.
Talk about your bearded lady.
Anyhow, honey, I found this old bag of kitty litter out in the garage.
It's supposed to activate when you scratch it.
Might be worth a shot.
Dad, it isn't funny.
You didn't see what I went through.
- I'm sorry, honey, I was a little busy.
- Yeah, hiding from liposuction Liza.
I wasn't hiding.
I just got stuck trying to get out the bathroom window.
I'm sorry, that lady is just plain weird.
(EXCLAIMS) She's not the only one.
Dad, I'm about to make you proud.
You're gonna go back upstairs and change? No, I'm going to make an audition tape.
You're looking at the next million dollar winner of Teen Wilderness Challenge.
I love that show! Last night the girl from Pittsburgh had to eat a live millipede.
Yeah, poor kid had 900 legs down her before that little critter hung a left and went out her nostril.
Jackson, you wouldn't last one day on Teen Wilderness Challenge.
Oh, yeah? Check it out.
(FLY BUZZING) (EXCLAIMS) (COUGHS) (FLY BUZZING) I like to throw the little ones back.
It's the way of the hunter.
My name is Jackson Rod Stewart, and I'm your next Teen Wilderness champion.
You get a lot of audition tapes with people telling you what they're going to do, well, I'm gonna show you.
(EXCLAIMS) I'm gonna survive for the next two weeks on this beach.
My only tools, these and this.
And a whole lot of this.
And of course these.
And these too, but that doesn't really count, 'cause I always use those.
Anyway, I'm gonna be completely isolated from all of civilization.
Sorry.
Oh, honey, get away from the strange man.
Hey, you can edit that out, right? Sure.
But I don't get it, you didn't bring any food.
How are you going to survive out here? Off the land, man! Nature's bounty is abundant.
Hey, now shoot this.
I'm gonna go up that tree and get some coconuts for dinner.
Hey Get in tight on my bear tooth.
It lets them know I'm a warrior.
Hey double O, I got two of them! (YELLING) Are you okay? Landed right on the coconuts.
Dad, I need to talk to you about something.
Hang on, bud.
I'm watching your brother.
He's been trying to open up a coconut for over half an hour.
- Oliver - I know, edit it out.
I don't know why I pay for cable when I got a son like him.
So, what's on your mind, bud? Daddy, is there any way that you can call the Eau Wow people and have them stop that commercial from going on the air? This thing's really eating at ya, isn't it? Yeah, that perfume makes me sick.
How can I go tell the world that I love it? Well, if that's how you feel, then I'll call the company and we'll put a stop to this thing right now.
Thanks, Dad.
That's a load off.
Now, cheer yourself up.
Take a look at your brother.
Oh! Wow.
That's gotta hurt! But you're right, it did cheer me up.
(DOORBELL RINGS) And so does knowing that Hannah isn't gonna lie to the whole world.
- Delivery from Eau Wow perfume.
- I hope it's muffins.
I love it when they send those teeny tiny muffins with those little chocolate chips - in them, and icing on the top - Dad.
Just bring it in.
Yeah, I don't think it'll fit through the door.
I was hoping for muffins.
- Oh.
- Wow.
"You wowed us.
Hope this wows you.
Your Eau Wow family.
" - Daddy, it's beautiful! - Yep.
Too bad we gotta send it back.
Say what? Hey, Mile, they're not gonna let us keep it once you back out of that commercial.
The only thing I'm backing out of is this driveway in my sweet new ride.
Now hold your horses.
I thought you said you couldn't stand the smell of that perfume.
Right now all I'm smelling is new car and - Muffins! - Eee doggies.
Those little chocolate chip ones.
Man, this car handles like a dream.
She really hugs the road.
Just think, one day you'll have your permit and you can really drive this thing.
I know.
Selling out was the best thing you ever did.
- I didn't sell out.
- Oh, please.
You did a commercial saying you loved something that makes you wanna yack.
Okay, maybe a little.
But everybody exaggerates in commercials.
I mean, do you really think that football player's mom follows him around with a can of soup? Doubt it! Hey, Mile, Eau Wow people just called.
You still sure about going through with this? (CAR HORN HONKING) - That's car talk for "Oh, yeah, baby!" - Okay, then, congratulations.
Tomorrow night you're going to be telling people how much you love the sweet smell of Eau Wow on The Real Deal With Collin Lassiter.
Collin Lassiter? That's the biggest interview show on TV.
Yup, I know, bud.
Hey, there's still time to pull the plug if you want to.
And give back our car? I mean, you do what you feel is right.
I'm just gonna sit here and enjoy what time I have left with Maria.
Lilly, don't worry.
Our car is not going anywhere.
You tell Collin I'll be there.
- Okay then, I'll go make the call.
- I'm so proud of you.
I could never go in front of the whole world and lie.
When I tell my dad I've finished my homework when I haven't, I start giggling like an idiot.
Well, that's the difference between me and you.
I can go on Collin's show and say that I love Eau Wow.
(GIGGLES) - What was that? - Nothing.
I just thought of something funny.
It's not like I was laughing because I was lying.
You did this to me.
After a six-hour hunt, I finally bagged this beauty, my first solid food in six hours and two minutes.
And now, I will start my own fire and cook my feast.
Though you gave me a fierce battle, oh, mighty crab, in the end, your primitive little brain was no match for mine.
Oh, man! Where'd he go? Dang flabbit! - Oliver? - Don't worry.
It's erased.
But I think you should know at this point, we only have 27 seconds of usable footage.
Who cares about footage? I'm starving.
Tell me about it.
Remember, we're going through this together.
You and me, side by side, living on nothing but - Pizza delivery for Oliver Oken.
- Right here, dude.
Oliver, you're brilliant.
Hey, give me a slice.
I can't do that, man.
Come on, I'll give you three puka shells and these magic fire sticks.
Jackson, get a grip.
You're stronger than this.
Sure, I could give you this pizza and you could stuff your face with the pepperoni and the sausage and the cheesy filled crust.
- But you don't want to do that.
- I don't? No! You're a Teen Wilderness Champion.
You've got this.
And a whole lot of this.
And all the other stuff.
Sure wish I could be more like you.
But I'm weak.
That's why I'm going to eat this in my tent.
Fine, you go ahead.
I don't need your stinking pizza.
I've got I've got rock grass! And seaweed and fresh air and nature's very own moonlight! WOMAN ON TV: Coming up on Channel 24 Weather, freak thunderstorms along the coast! We might even see some hail! (THUNDER RUMBLING) I can do this.
I can do this.
I'm a Teen Wilderness Champion, I am a Teen Wilderness Champion.
Got a splinter.
Blood! The blood of a warrior.
(GRUNTING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Man, that rain is really coming down out there.
I hope Jackson's okay.
(WHISTLING) What in tarnation ( JACKSON HOWLING) Thanks.
That's good.
Hannah, I just want you to remember this.
Whatever happens out here, I love you, and I really love that car.
Please don't blow this.
Lola, chillax.
I got it all figured out.
- All I have to do is not lie.
- Yes.
If I don't lie, then I won't giggle.
For example, ask me what I think of the perfume.
What do you think of the perfume? It's like nothing I have ever smelled before.
You see? No giggles.
Hey, darling, the more I think about it, the more I think going on this show's a bad idea.
Daddy, you worry too much.
What if he brings out a bottle of that perfume and you get a whiff of it? Thought about it.
I've already got about a pound of VapoRub in my nose.
Right now I could smell one of Jackson's dirty socks and live to tell the tale.
I'll have to remember that next time I go visit Uncle Earl and he's cooked up a pot of that three-bean chili.
You sure you're okay? Trust me, Dad, everything is going to be fine.
- What's so funny? - What's not funny, Dad? You gotta learn to laugh more.
It's gonna be a breeze.
Howdy, partner! (SHUDDERS) Just came by to wish you luck.
Wait up, cowboy! (MEOWS) You had to plant that giggling thing in my head.
Look on the bright side.
You can always cover giggling by saying something was funny.
I mean, it's not like you're Oliver.
When he lies, he hiccups.
And we're back with pop sensation Hannah Montana.
We've talked about your new CD and your European tour.
Let's get the real deal on this commercial.
Is that true? Had you really never smelled anything like it before? I can honestly say, throughout all the perfumes that I've worn, it is totally unique, and that's the truth.
So you weren't just acting.
You honestly love this stuff.
Well, I mean, have you seen the bottle? It's beautiful.
Round with a little point.
Yeah, it's great.
But I'm asking you about what's inside.
Do you like the perfume, yes or no? Well, of course the answer has to be Yes.
Well, that's good to hear.
I'm glad you're not one of those celebrities who goes out and pushes something she doesn't believe in.
That's not me.
(CHOKING) Got a little something.
- What an adorable laugh you have.
- Glad you like it.
- You're gonna be hearing it quite a lot.
- Great.
Artie says our switchboard is going crazy.
So let's take some calls.
Okay.
Caitlin from Michigan.
You're on with Hannah Montana.
CAITLIN: Hannah, I love you and I can't wait to smell like you! Do you wear Eau Wow every day? - Well, not every day.
- Why not? I don't want to waste it.
(HICCUPS) There was an ant.
- You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
Just a little nervous about being on your show.
You're actually much more handsome in person.
(HICCUPS) Isn't she the cutest thing? Big star like her still gets nervous.
You know, when I get nervous, I sweat Like a pig.
Thanks, Collin.
Good to know.
All right.
Let's take our next caller.
Brianna from Georgia.
BRIANNA: Hannah, I'm such a big fan.
I can't believe I'm talking to you.
I hear your perfume smells like raspberries.
I love raspberries.
Don't you love raspberries? Well I really don't like singling out any one fruit as my favorite.
It's so unfair to all the other fruits.
But it's in your perfume, so you gotta like raspberries, right? Yes or no? Yes.
I mean, who doesn't like a good raspberry? Well, Brianna.
Thanks for the call.
Read a book, eat your vegetables, always be polite.
- Thanks, Hannah.
I do love - So, Collin How about that hail storm last night? Hannah, you need a tissue or a bath towel? No, thanks.
I'm good.
(HICCUPS) How ya feeling, bud? I'm really glad I told the Eau Wow people that I couldn't endorse their perfume.
The truth is always the best thing.
Even though sometimes it hurts.
It really, really hurts.
I'm going to miss her so much.
I'll never forget you, Maria.
Lilly, calm down, it's really not that great of a car anyway.
(GIGGLES) I'm gonna miss you, too, Maria.
It's okay.
We'll survive.
Hey, speaking of surviving, anybody heard from your brother? I just got a call from that Teen Wilderness Challenge show.
He's been turned down.
How do you think he's gonna take it? ( JACKSON HOWLING) (CRASHING) Not so good.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR) As if I didn't feel bad enough already.
Stewart! I'm sick of your leaves in my pool! Well, I'm sick of your face in my house.
Whoa, Jethro, since you're not whittling right now, why don't you use your hands to cover your mouth? Uncle Albert, I want to swim! What's taking so long? I thought you said the hillbilly was scared of you! He is.
Look, I've got him trembling.
Come on, I'm only here for the weekend and you said we'd do stuff.
- Stop nagging.
- I wanna do stuff! - Stop nagging! - I wanna do stuff! Stop nagging! I don't know where she gets it from.
Keep your leaves out of my pool! (DOOR SLAMS) Finally, some peace and quiet.
Dad! - It was nice while it lasted.
Dad, why aren't you dressed? The Stella Fabiani Fashion Show is tomorrow and you promised you'd take me and Lilly to the mall to get shoes, makeup and manicures.
- You did.
I remember.
I was there.
- Yeah.
Come on, come on, let's boogie! Oh, not that kind of boogie.
I'm sorry, honey, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to take you.
This thing's knocked me flatter than Uncle Earl's inflatable butt cushion after football season! Now there's a mental picture I really didn't need.
It's okay, Dad.
Feel better, get well.
- I'll just make Jackson take me.
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No way! It's not gonna happen! Cooper and I are going to a Dodger game today.
And I'm breaking in a new foam finger.
Jackson, Lilly and I have stuff we have to do, and you go to a baseball game practically every weekend.
This is so unfair.
Every time you can't haul her all over town, I'm the one who gets stuck doing it.
I miss baseball games, basketball games, parties.
I mean, I have a life of my own and I am sick of you ruining it! And I'm sick as a dog.
So stop complaining.
Take your sister where she needs to go.
- I'll get you tickets to another game.
- Fine.
Man.
Now what am I supposed to do with my new foam finger? Oh, I know, you can use it to wipe away your whiny little tears.
Get over it! (SINGING) Come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun It's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds (LAUGHING) Oh, why do I always look? Hey, Daddy, how're you feeling? Sorry, darling, but I just don't think I'm gonna be able to take you to that fashion show this evening.
Oh, that's fine, Daddy.
I'll just make Jackson No! No, no, no, no, no, no! You already ruined my Saturday.
You can't have my Sunday, too.
Jackson, stop complaining.
If it wasn't for me, you would've been stuck at that stupid baseball game all day yesterday.
And I heard on the news that one team didn't even have any hits.
They call it a no-hitter! Exactly.
Boring! (COUGHING) Dad, you sound great! You are really getting it out! Speaking of getting it out, maybe a little fresh air would do you good.
Maybe drive Miley to the fashion show? No.
Oh, come on, you're just gonna let a little cold beat you? You're just gonna abandon your son in his time of need? Yeah.
California's made you soft, old man! I can't believe how selfish you're being.
Dad's sick, and I need a little help, and all you've done is complain.
Oh, please, if you were me, you'd do exactly the same thing.
No, see, Jackson, that's where you're wrong.
If I was lucky enough to have a little sister, I'd change my plans when she needed my help and I would do it without whining like a little baby.
(WHINING) Okay, see, that's easy to say when you don't actually have a little sister.
Not my fault.
I always wanted one.
Yeah, I always wanted a puppy but they brought you home instead.
Too bad.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) (SNEEZES) Your father gave me his backwoods cold.
Yesterday, I was the picture of health.
Now look at me, I'm withering away to nothing.
Well, on the bright side, maybe you'll see your toes by Christmas.
Listen, Junior, I'm stuck with my niece for the weekend, but now I'm too sick to schlep her around.
So congratulations, you've won an 8-year-old for the day.
I don't think so.
Are you gonna grow any more or is that it? Okay, bye-bye.
Stewart, please, please.
I'm begging here.
What do you want me to do, get down on my knees? Look, there's no way that I could put up with this brat for a whole day.
I mean, I've already got one upstairs who always wanted a little sister.
And you are perfect.
Hey, Miles! I got a little present for you! I don't know what you're up to, and I don't care.
Have her home by dinner.
If I don't answer the door, stick her through the mail slot! All right, here's five bucks.
Just keep your mouth shut for two minutes.
Make it 10, you've got a deal, leprechaun.
What present? What are you talking about? Who's this? Hi, sweetie.
What's your name? This is Patty.
She's Dontzig's niece and your new little sister for the day.
- What? - He's sick, she needs a babysitter.
You always said you wanted a little sister.
Well, ta-da! You've got two wishes left.
If you need me, I'll be in the lamp.
- What's wrong with her? - She's shy.
Oh, that's so cute.
Sorry, sweetheart, I can't, I've already made plans.
Which somebody already knew about.
Oh, you've got plans.
Kind of like the ones I had to give up yesterday for you.
That's That's totally different.
The fashion show is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
So was the no-hitter! All right? The truth is, you are just too selfish to give up one day of your life for a sweet, innocent, little girl, the way I always do for you.
- That's so not true.
- Oh, please.
- You wouldn't last one day with this kid.
- Oh, yeah? Doing whatever she wants without a single complaint.
- You wanna bet? - Yes, I do.
Right now.
But, you know I've got to go to that fashion show Coward.
Gutless.
Chicken.
Cowardly gutless chicken.
(CLUCKING) Okay, okay, okay, fine! I'll give up my fashion show.
But when I win, which I will, you have to drive me around wherever I want to go, whenever I want to go, without a single complaint, for the rest of my non-driving life! And when you don't, which you won't, all right, then I am free, forever.
Whatever she wants.
No complaints.
- Deal.
- Deal.
Three, two, one.
- Make me a sandwich or I'll scream.
- What? (SCREAMING) You set me up.
Do I hear a complaint? Do we already have a winner? No, no, no.
Forget it.
I'm not caving.
I'm gonna get through this afternoon.
And for dinner, I'm gonna watch you eat a big slice of humble pie.
You know what I wanna watch? You making me my sandwich! Now close your mouth and open the fridge.
I'm not getting any younger! Okay, listen here, kid, I've only got one thing to tell you.
White or wheat? Hey, Roxy, you don't need to come over.
I'm feeling much, much better.
- Is that so? - Yes, ma'am.
As a matter of fact I was just heading out for a jog.
Then why're you lying on the couch in that ratty old robe? - How did you - You can't lie to Roxy.
Roxy knows everything.
I'm omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent.
Look them up, country boy.
Hey, I appreciate what you're trying to do but your job's not to take care of me, it's to be a bodyguard for Hannah Montana.
That's just the fever talking.
You know, we're just like family.
Now, just let your Aunt Roxy take care of those nasty, nasty germs.
- But what if you get sick? - Ha! Roxy ain't afraid of no germs, germs are afraid of Roxy.
Now, the first thing we're gonna do is get you in the shower.
Steam those suckers out and open up those pores.
Plus, you are a little ripe.
That would be the smell of fear.
Besides, I can't even make it up those stairs.
That's where 60 hours of fire-fighting training comes in handy.
Now just relax and enjoy the ride.
Put me down! Stop it! Why did I give you a house key? How's it going so far, Miles? Any complaints? No, after she ran over me with her boogie board and threw up on me in the kayak, you know, this is actually kind of relaxing.
Except for the sand crabs, but I'm not complaining.
Glad to hear it.
Hey, Patty, wanna get some ice cream? Yeah! - Patty, can I get up now? - No way.
When I get back, I wanna take a picture.
And don't move.
You heard her.
Don't move! And just remember, I'm still gonna win the bet.
As long as you don't move.
Try not to think about the sand crabs.
Right.
Not thinking.
I'm not thinking.
That was a big one! (SQUEALING) (SHOUTS) (MOUTHING) Roxy, how long do I have to stay in this thing? Oh, honey, you're just medium rare.
We're looking to get you all the way to well done.
Look at that, I've been so busy taking care of you, I almost forgot about lunch.
What're you doing? I hate it when my burger sticks to my pan, or in this case, my man! I don't understand why you don't just dump the kid and go home.
And I don't understand why you eat with your face.
I'm not dumping the kid because I'm winning the bet! Look at her.
I'm tired.
I wanna go back to Uncle Albert's.
Watch this, I'm gonna win this bet and get to go to my fashion show.
Any minute now she's gonna come over here and say - I wanna go home.
- Yes! - No! - Game over! I was this close to cracking.
But I didn't.
(SINGING) She's done, I won I didn't cave, now you're my slave I get to go to the fashion show (LAUGHS TRIUMPHANTLY) Slow down, Busta Rhymes.
You can't go home yet.
There's gotta be something else you wanna do.
What about a moose? From the world-famous Make A Moose Store.
They've got a Make A Moose here? Are you kidding? It's one of the biggest in the country.
My brother goes there all the time, and he loves it! Oliver! She doesn't want to go there.
Honey, you don't wanna go to Make A Moose.
It's just a bunch of hot, sweaty, screaming kids, fighting over moose parts.
Doesn't that sound like fun? And don't forget that cute song.
(SINGING) Make, make, make a moose here at Make A Moose Make a moose, make a moose make a moose, make a moose here at Make A Moose - Oliver! - I'm sorry.
It's catchy.
Now, honey, didn't you say you were tired? Wouldn't you much rather go home and relax and just watch some TV? - Well - Or you could go home later and watch TV and cuddle up with your new best friend, Moosey McMooserpants.
That's what you really wanna do.
No, what you really want to do is go home and relax.
Aah! - Make a Moose.
Ooh! - Go home and relax.
Aah! Make a Moose.
Ooh! I think I wanna go make a moose! (GROANS) (CHILDREN SCREAMING) This is so cool! And it's even noisier than I thought! What's the matter, you got a headache? No, I'm just seeing where my antlers would attach if I had them.
(BLOWING HORN) All first time moose makers to the clearing.
Come on.
(CELL PHONE RINGING) Lilly, I don't want to hear how incredible the fashion show is.
Okay, then I won't tell you how celebrity model Lindsay Lohan twisted her ankle.
Isn't that great? Why is that great? Because they told me if Hannah Montana could get here before the finale, she could fill in and keep the one-of-a-kind Stella Fabiani dress.
Lilly, I don't wanna hear about this.
I'm sending you a picture now.
And I don't want to see it, either.
(BEEPS) Oh, it is beautiful! Why are you doing this to me? Pretty.
You know, if I was you, I would do anything to own that dress.
That precious, precious dress.
Hear that? (SINGING) Give, give, give up the bet give it up right now No.
No, no, no, I'm gonna win this bet and get the dress.
Lilly, tell Stella I'll be there faster than she can say "make a moose.
" Why would Stella Fabiani say "make a moose"? Just tell her I'll be there! - Okay, Patty, let's goose this moose! - Welcome to Make A Moose! - I'm Moose Master Mike.
- Who cares? Like my grandma says on Thanksgiving, "Let's get to the stuffing!" - Wait, I have a question.
- No, you don't.
You said there were over - Could you name them all? - Of course.
You better learn to sleep with your eyes open.
Yeah.
Number one.
Moose Lee.
(EXCLAIMING) Number 23.
Moose Skywalker.
May the forest be with you.
'Cause it's a moose.
(EXCLAIMING) Perfect.
Roxy's hot pot of burning funk.
Oh, yeah.
That's it.
You don't want your funk too hot or too cold, you want your funk just right.
Now get ready.
It looks delicious, Roxy, but I'm just not hungry.
Oh, honey, you don't eat the funk, the funk eats you.
Whoa, what are you doing? What Hey.
My sinuses, they're opening up.
Mmm-hmm.
I can finally breathe.
- What's that horrible smell? - Oh, that's the funk! Number 49.
I love Moosey.
Hey, Moosey, I'm home! (MIMICKING CRYING) Fifty more.
Or you could quit now and get to Stella.
Forget it.
I'm not quitting! Come on, Patty, let's make a moose! Please stay with the herd.
Tell it to someone who cares, Bullwinkle! Here you go.
Hannah Moosetana! - How lame.
- She's perfect.
Ha! - Except she needs more stuffing.
- Ha! I'd like to stuff something all right.
- Complaining? - No.
Of course not.
Oh, come on.
Faster! Faster! Put it off! My moose is getting too big! Oh, man.
It won't shut off.
Abusing the stuffer will result in confiscation of your moose.
There was no moose abuse.
We were just looking.
- Go about your business, please.
- Wait, I have a question.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.
I was just wondering, what is the difference between a moose and a caribou? That's my favorite question.
First of all, a moose is larger.
Much, much larger.
Well, then maybe my moose should be bigger! - Your moose is fine.
- But he said I don't care what he said! I've done enough for you! I'm sick of this! I have my own life! And I'm not gonna let you ruin it! - That's it! I win! You blew up! - I did not blow up! Now I blew up.
You know, when I pictured winning the bet, I never quite pictured it like this.
Oh, really? That's funny.
I always pictured myself with my pants blown off, forced to wear an itchy moose suit.
Remember, it's a loaner.
Is lugging me around really as awful as what you put me through today? Yeah.
No, but sometimes it feels that way.
But you know the part that bothers me the most? - What? - You never even ask.
You just kind of expect it.
And you never say thanks.
You're right.
I don't.
But since I won the bet, I guess we don't have to worry about it anymore.
Yeah, I guess not.
And, Jackson, I'm really sorry for all the things you had to miss 'cause of me.
Thanks.
Now, we better get a move on if we're gonna drop Patty off, get to that fashion show and get you that dress.
- What? - Well, it's different when I offer.
Then I'm doing it because I want to, not because I have to.
- Miles, you don't have to do that.
- I know.
I'm doing it 'cause I want to.
- And thanks.
- You're welcome.
- Come on, Patty, let's go.
- This was the best day ever! I'm so glad Uncle Albert pretended to be sick! - What? - What? Oops! I can't believe you guys made it.
She's gonna look so good in that dress.
- And then she gets to keep it.
- If she can get in it.
Why would she not be able to get in it? When I left her backstage, she was having a little trouble with the stuck zipper.
- There's no zipper on that dress.
- I'm not talking about the dress.

Well, I'm just gonna go out for a run now so, please, don't feel like you have to wait here for me.
Please, don't.
Just let me collect my lotions and potions.
And sorry about that pot.
I guess even cast iron can't stand up to Roxy's funk.
(SIGHS) - You sure you're okay, Dad? - I feel horrible, Son.
But if I don't get that woman out of here, she's gonna nurse me to death.
What part of "Roxy hears everything" don't you understand? Now put on your suit, Tin Man, I'm throwing my hot stones on the grill and a porterhouse on your chest! Could we have some of your great homemade soup with that? Soup? What soup? Oh, no! The boy ate the funk! Hold on, Jackson, I'm gonna brew up a pot of anti-funk.

Yeah.
Okay.
Well, he's seen it now.

So one other person knows, it doesn't mean they're going to tell everyone at lunch.
Oh, no.
l'm getting another text! -What's it say? -''l'm going to tell everybody at lunch.
'' Wow, creepy.
What's ''Mwah-ah-ah-ah''? l think it's more like ln two hours, any chance l have of being a normal high school girl is over.
Yeah, tell me about it.
lf people find out you're Annah-hay Ontana-may, you won't be able to go to any school.
Except maybe in the South Pole, completely cut off from civilisation, where you'll eventually go mad.
Mad, l tell you.
Mad! You put extra sugar in your cereal this morning, didn't you? Yes, and now the room is spinning.
-Hello.
-Hey.
Hello.
Hey, again.
Whoa, this is a hoot.

The new guy, don't you know? Okay, well, we'll see you at the 25th reunion.
Where you going? Those guys said you were the welcoming committee.

Hey, l'll race you to the fourth floor.
Okay! Hey, man, we don't have a fourth floor.
Oops.

You told someone my secret, didn't you? Didn't you? No, l swear! And easy on the pecs.
They pop.
Oh, no, incoming.
''Wondering what you can do to stop me? l have an idea.
'' -Who is this? -l don't know! l got it! All we have to do is look for the person texting.
That narrows it down to everybody.
l love chemistry.
lt's educational and delicious.
Can l get you some chocolate and graham crackers to go with that? Yeah, that'd be Totally inappropriate because l shouldn't even be doing this.
Okay, people, let's stop fooling around.
-Now, lose the marshmallow, Stewart! -Yes, ma'am.
Hot, hot, hot.
Really hot.
-Hi, is this seat taken? -No, go for it.

And l'm Thor, his new best buddy, and l was kind of hoping l could sit there.
No! -Go.
-l get it.
You like her.
He likes you.
Look at his face, it's redder than a cow's udder on a cold day.
Of course, they're pretty much always red, what with all the yanking, don't you know? Maybe you two should sit together, and l'll sit any place else.
But l have marshmallows.
You know, since she doesn't seem to be interested in you, you mind if l take a shot? l bet they want something like money or concert tickets.
lf it was me, l'd take your jewellery and your wardrobe.
And your shoes! Oh, yeah, your shoes! Turn around, l'll give you one of my shoes right now.
Sorry, l'm just trying to get into the mind of a criminal.
lf you can understand them, you can catch them.
And then what, Sherlock? As long as they know my secret, l'll have to do whatever they want.
What kind of monster would torture me like this? Morning, let's welcome a special young man to our class.
He skipped a couple of grades, so he's a little younger.
And a lot smarter.
This is Rico.
Hiya, toots, get my messages? Don't worry, Mrs Espinosa.
We'll take good care of the new kid.
Okay.
All right, short stack, how'd you find out? Simple.
You were careless, and l had a camera phone.
Give me that phone or you'll never make it to four feet! Feel free to pat me down, kitten, but it's safe in my locker.
Step aside, squirt, and let the locker doctor operate.
Oh, yeah.
Wow, that's a really big jersey for such a little l didn't say that was my locker.
Hey, fresh-meat, what're you doing crammed inside my locker? l'm not crammed inside My mom's a cop! Okay.
Rico, you know my secret.
What's it gonna take to shut you up? You.
As my girlfriend.
Say what? Don't flatter yourself, doll-face.
This is strictly business.
l need some hall cred in this place, and you can help me get it.
So all he's looking for is a little arm candy.
That, and someone to reach the top shelf of my locker.
-You can totally do that.
-You can totally shut up.
Of course, if you'd rather l send the picture to everyone at school Miley, you have to do what he says.
lt's either that or your secret's out.
So far, high school stinks.
Yeah, l remember how l met my woman.
l had just come out of the ocean.
My skin was shining like Like What was it shining like, love monkey? A new penny in the piggy bank of my heart.
What can l say? She's crazy in love.
Cheese me.
Enough! Sorry, l just got so lost in your eyes.
Your beady little eyes.

Right.
Please forgive me.
Now, go get daddy a moist towelette and make it hot like my Latin blood.
Of course, my little matador.
''You know, Bud, you can always be home-schooled.
'' ''No, Daddy, l want to go to school like a normal kid.
'' What was l thinking? There you are! l've got great news! Unless it involves a time machine and Rico's parents never meeting, l don't want to know.
Fine, then l won't tell you that Oliver found Rico's locker.
Great! That means we have to go find Rico's And l'm gonna stop talking now and follow you.
That would be nice.

l just couldn't take it any more.
-Take what? -Okay.

lf l have to hear that stupid accent one more time, l'm gonna beat myself unconscious with a frozen trout, don't you know? l seem to remember another new kid that talked funny a few years ago.
They called him a hick, too.
Let's see.
What was his name? Packson? Sackson? Howdy, everybody.

That's what l said.
Blang! What a loser.
Ride 'em, cowboy! Crackson, Shellackson.
Enough, Dad! l already had the flashback.
What l'm saying, Son, if you think about what happened to you, you might wanna cut this boy some slack.
But why is this my problem? l mean, nobody ever cut me a break.
lf l had to tough it out, then so can he.
And that's exactly what l'm gonna tell him.
l know, but l was just thinking if you would just Good day.

Would it have killed you to let me have this one? Guys, please! Some time before Rico and l honeymoon in Hobbit Town! Okay.
Step aside, ladies.
The doctor is in.
Look at all the plants and that waterfall.

-Who cares? Can you see the phone? Yeah.

Okay, l'll stall Rico.
Oliver, make friends with the monkey.
And exactly how do l do that? Just be yourself.
He'll think you're family.
High school's made you hard.
-Coconut! -What kind of comeback is -Rico! -Hi.
Honey, where are you going? l've got to grab some books out of my locker.
But save the ''honey'' thing for later.
Daddy likey.
You can't leave me! You can cut the act, string bean.
Nobody's watching.
lt's not an act.
Look, Rico.
l know l said l couldn't stand you, but the truth is, deep down, way, way deep down, l've always thought you were a A hunk.
Really? May l be hit by lightning if l'm lying.
Who wants to trade a silly little phone for a nice banana? Why would he want a stupid banana? Yeah, he's got a snow-cone machine and a mini-fridge This feels so right, and yet something haunts me.
How can l be sure your love is true? You're on my lap, aren't you? Perhaps you could prove your love with a kiss.
Okay.
Who do you want me to kiss? Okay, fine.
l'll do it.
Let me just ready myself.
You know, this may This will take some time.
Get your stinking paws off me, you darn dirty ape! -Use your muscles! -They're in my book bag! Hello! My lips are chapping.
Let's get smacking! -We got it! -We got the phone! Kiss the chicken, bub! Your little blackmail scheme is over! l think not.
Come here, chuckleheads.
This is the real phone.
Now, you're gonna plant one right here, or l'll press send, and everybody'll know your precious little secret.
Miley, just close your eyes.
lt'll be over before you know it.
No, it won't.
lt'll never end.
He's going to hold this over me for the rest of my life.
Passion and brains.
l repeat Okay, listen here, rinky-dink.
Go ahead.
Send the picture, but if you think it's going to impress anybody at this school, you're wrong.
Sure, they'll know my secret, but they'll also know what a pathetic loser you are.
So press send.
Nothing can be much worse than this.
Here.
You win.
Really? Yeah.
lt's just that l've always been the youngest in my class and the smallest, and just once l wanted to fit in.
To be cool.
You smell like wet monkey.
And to get a girl like you to kiss me, well, that'd be the coolest thing ever.
Rico, hold on.
You know, if you'd been this real with me from the beginning, things might have been different.
You mean you would've kissed me? l'm not talking major lip lock, but a little cheek action.
Sure.
When you treat people nice, Rico, they're gonna treat you nice back.
As a matter of fact Come here, handsome, 'cause you know l can't resist you.
Yes! He shoots, he scores! He's toast! You better run, pal.
l've never seen her so mad.
Wait till you see what Rico thought was her big secret.
Help, monkey, help! How's it going? Can l get a little more syrup? 

l hate flag football.
lt's just one more sport where l get picked last.
-And you wanna know why? -'Cause you stink? Or 'cause you're pretty and all the other girls are jealous? Nice save.
Okay, look, l know l'm not good, but l'm not horrible.
Look alive, Stewart.
Okay, l'm horrible, but you just don't know what it feels like to always be the last one picked because no one wants to be with Stinky Stewart.
Not true.
Last year in soccer, l wasn't picked till practically the end.
You had a broken collarbone, and you still got picked ahead of me! l just wish, one time, some miracle would happen and l wouldn't get picked last.
All right, Palumbo, Truscott, team captains.
Pick your team.
Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Finally! A captain who'll pick me first! lt doesn't matter who you pick, Truscott.
Your team is going down.
ln your dreams, Palumbo.
You've been trying to beat me at something since the second grade, and, newsflash, never gonna happen.
Hey, Stinky, how you doing? Not bad Hey! Let's go, ladies.
Pick your teams.
You're slower than my husband in the bathroom.
Curse the day he put that plasma screen in there.
Pick first, Truscott.
You're gonna need all the help you can get.
She's not the one that's gonna need the help.
-Yeah? -Yeah! Darn right, yeah! You're going down, Phoney Joannie.
-Who smells like week-old bologna.
-That's been in your locker all alone-y.
Right next to that That Melted ice-cream cone-y.
Girl, you are in the zone-y! Yo, Salt-N-Pepa.
You wanna bet on it? Does she? How about winning captain gets to give losing captain a little haircut? You're on! Or we could bet a quarter.
'Cause, you know, it's just about the fun of competition.
No, it's really about the fun of me kicking your butt again.
Yeah.
That's it.
You're on! Go ahead, Lilly.
Pick away, make my day, everything's gonna be okay -Kowalski.
-What'd you say? Wow.
lsn't it funny how it always comes down to the two of us? Yeah, hilarious.
l hope you don't get picked last this time.
Yeah, me, too! Careful, you almost hit that anthill.
And even these tiny creatures are very important to our ecosystem.
Pick your poison, Truscott.
You're getting a buzz cut either way.
l pick Sarah.
Good luck, Stinky.

Let's get out of here.
Hey, darling, you still upset about what happened with you and Lilly? No, of course not.
Why would you say that? Well, you normally don't introduce True Friend as a touching little song about a two-faced backstabber.
Just my way of keeping things fresh.
You know, l'm an artist, that's what l do.
Well, l'm a dad, and knowing that that's a hunk of hooey, that's what l do.
Am l gonna get another lecture? Maybe later.
Right now, l gotta get this dang moustache off.
Lola, be thankful you don't have to wear one of these things.
lt's itchier than a baboon's butt at a flea circus.
Well, look who showed up.
Were all the other concerts in town sold out? Because l know you wouldn't have picked mine first.
Or second.
Or last! Hey, l was gonna pick you until you started that whole haircut thing.
And what's the big deal, anyway? l won! Do you wanna share the trophy? l couldn't have done it without your three fumbles.
lt's a stupid game! The ball's not even round.
Hannah! Hey, guys! What's up, Traci? You just get better and better! l loved the little backstabbing quip.
So funny! That wasn't about me, was it? No, no, no, no.
Of course not.

Look at this.
This spinach has hair on it.
That's not spinach, that's a piece of chicken.
Look, Dad, l'll get to it.
When? When this stuff up and crawls away? You think it could do that? 'Cause that would be so cool.
That's it.
l ask you to do the dishes, l get green chicken.
l ask you to separate the whites in the laundry, and l get green underwear.
Well, what are you worried about? Nobody's gonna see them, unless you do that sunrise yoga out on the deck again.
Talk about your lt centres me, boy.
l shouldn't have to tell you things over and over again, Jackson.
You're not 1 0 years old.
Okay, okay, l'm sorry.
No, you're not.
You're just saying that because you're afraid l'm going to ground you.
Come on, Dad, l apologised.
You want me to mean it, too? Yes.
Jackson, l want you to hear me when l'm talking to you, but since you never listen, l'm just not going to waste my breath any more.

-Chocolate or vanilla? -Actually, it's pistachio You talked to me! You finally talked to me! That's because even though l didn't say anything, you finally heard me.
Yeah, l did.
Loud and clear.
Jackson, that's all a parent ever wants.
That and grandkids.
Now? Don't worry.
No rush on that one.
What is taking Oliver so long? What do you expect? lt's Oliver.
Now would you stop pacing? -Would you stop sitting? -No.
Fine! Man, you owe me an apple.
Would you keep it down? l'm on the phone! Hey, Oliver, where are you? Great.
Just meet us down at the studio.
Okay, Oliver has to go down to the police station and get the key from his mom, and l've gotta get ready.
Not until you buy me another apple.
Forget about the apple.
Help me get ready and you can keep any three Hannah outfits you want, okay? -What about shoes? -One pair.
-Two.
-Nothing ltalian.
Fine.
Okay.
This may be harder than we thought.
-Yeah.
Let's go change.
-Okay.
Okay, this is definitely not an improvement.
Your feet stink! Yeah? How do you like them now? lt's a little tight, but l think it may work.
Let's go take a look in the mirror.
Goodness.
Lovely.
Look at that.
l knew you two couldn't stay mad at each other.
Yeah.
We're closer than ever.
You wanna tell me how this happened? Well, Oliver thought that if he put us Sweet niblets, l wish that boy would stop doing that.
Well, none of this would've happened if you would've just picked me.
Yeah, l am not the one who gave a limo ride to a plant.
At least if Fern was playing flag football, she would've just picked me.
-lt's a ficus! -Named Fern! You could not pay me enough money to be a teenage girl.
-l got the key, l got the key! -Thank you.
You're live in one minute, Miss Montana.
Get 'er done, son.
Carrie Underwood is on stage announcing that Hannah's won the award right now.
l haven't even thought about what l'm going to say yet.
Well, lucky for you, l did.
All you gotta to do is read the TelePrompTer.
Your daddy's thought of everything.
Except the key breaking.
-Uh-oh.
-l hate when he says uh-oh.
Yeah, it's almost as bad as when he thinks.
-Live in 30 seconds! -Oh, boy.
Gee, l wonder what's gonna happen now.
Gee, l wonder what's gonna happen now.
l have an idea! -No! -No! Normally, l'd agree, but this is a good one.
Accepting her award, live from Los Angeles, Hannah Montana.
Thank you so much for this incredible honour.
And it means even more knowing that it's coming from the good folks in Nashville, the place that l'm proud to call my hometown.
Hooray, Nashville! l only wish that l could be there in person to tell you how l truly feel.
This is my special wave to Grandma.
Hi, Grandma! Bye, Grandma.
Every time that l hear True Friend, it always makes me think about About real friendship.
Sorry.
l had a little something in my teeth.
All better.
As l was saying, friendship means a lot to me.
ln fact, this song was inspired by my My best friend.
She's been with me through everything, and even though sometimes we fight, we know we'll always get through it because, well, we love each other.
And nothing says it better than this song.
''True friends will go to the ends of the earth ''till they find the things you need.
''Friends hang on through the ups and the downs'' Bless you.
'''Cause they've got someone to believe in.
'' Thank you for believing in me, and thank you for this award.
l love you all.
Good night.

You're slower than my husband in the bathroom.

-l could never imagine why.
-Yeah.
Okay, l pick Joannie.

Told you it would work.
Now unlock us.
l thought you had the key.
-Man.
-Think fast! 

He goes from the top of the key.
He shoots, he scores! l cannot believe Justin Timberlake is from the same species.
Some boys are such pigs.
-Lilly! -What? Close your mouth.
We're in the ninth grade.
You got to start acting more like, l don't know, a girl.
What are you talking about? l act like a girl all the time.
lncoming! Truscott from downtown! Don't say boo-yah, don't say boo-yah.
Boo-yah! Yeah, nice shot, Shaq.
Muy macko.
lt's ''macho.
'' Whatever.
You know l'm bad at French.
Well, at least l know how to be a girl.
l never thought this day would come, but Amber and Ashley are right.
l hate you for making me say that.
They're not right! l know how to be a girl.
Yeah? Then why don't you have a date for the dance on Friday? Not everyone is going to the dance.
You're not going.

Different thing than her thing, but a thing.
Big thing.

And basta with the pasta already! Like that is gonna do any good.
Well, it looks like it's working for Matt Marshall.
Matt Marshall! l've been crushing on him ever since the first time -Hey, Lilly.
-'Sup, Matt? Act like a girl.
So, Matthew, come here often? Of course he does, it's school! So are you going to the dance this Friday? No, l don't think l'll actually l don't know.
Maybe.
Why do you ask? l just thought if you were going then, you know, we could maybe -Carpool? -No, l kind of meant -Yeah? -What? -What? -Sweet niblets.
Of course she'll go to the dance with you! -Cool! -Cool.
l'm going to the dance with Matt! Yes! How do l do it? come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar?

Let's listen as Judge Joe hands down his verdict in the case of ''Bobby and Michael and the Busted Motorcycle.
'' Bobby, you borrowed a bike and brought it back busted.
That's bologna.
And speaking of food, it's time for justice to be served.
-Serve it up.

Yes, sir, Big D, that is some sweet justice.
case closed.
Dude, he got served! Breakfast, lunch, and This is what you were talking about, right? Yeah.

l'd like to dedicate this song to a special friend who l hope is having an awesome time tonight.
How did l get here? l turned around and there you were l didn't think twice or rationalise 'cause somehow l knew That there was more than just chemistry l mean, l knew you were kind of into me But l figured it's too good to be true Go ahead, honey.
l'll be right there.
Lilly, what are you doing here? l tried calling you every time l got offstage.
Were you a little too busy with Matt? He stood me up.
-What? -l sat at home waiting for two hours.
Lilly.
Look at you.
l bet some hearts were broken tonight.
Just one.
Way to go, Dad.
How can boys be so cruel? How could someone do something like that to Lilly? Don't they know how delicate and fragile girls are? Sugar and spice and hands like a vice.
Heaven help the boy who stands you up.
You got that right, bub! Morning.
-How you feeling? -Okay.
-Thanks for letting me sleep over.
-lt was our pleasure, Lilly.
Lilly! That's what Matt called me! -Dad! -That's her name.
-Think a little! -Okay.
Would you like some bacon, little pieces of bacon? No, thanks.
But don't let me spoil your morning.
You go ahead and live your happy lives.
Enjoy.
-Dad, maybe you should -Gotcha.
l'm just gonna go out on the deck and eat.
l just need to get one of these placemats.
Matt! Out! Lilly, l hate seeing you like this.
lt's not right.
There's got to be a way to get him back for all the pain and suffering he's caused you.
l'd like to know how.
Have you been put through pain and suffering? Did someone do you wrong? -They did her wrong! -Heck, yeah! Well, don't just sit there and take it, take it to court.
The Teen Court.
-Where justice is served.
-Where justice is served! Hey, Dad, l need to talk to you about these tickets.
Who cares if your boy got into Harvard? My boy's taking me to the Laker game.
Yep.
Courtside seats.
He could've taken anybody he wanted to, but he decided to take the old man.
Yep.
All right, Fred, listen, l got to get off here.
l got to go give my boy a big bear hug.
Talk at you later.
My boy! So what was it you wanted to say about the tickets? They have holograms.
Look, he's dunking, now he's not.
Dunking.
Not.
Dunking.
Not.
Dunking.
Not.
Dunking.
Not.
Dunking.
Not.
Bye.
My boy.
My strange, strange boy.
Hey, Dad! What's up, good buddy? Hey, hey, l just wanted to tell you how much l'm looking forward to going to that game with you tonight, sitting side by side, right next to each other.
Excuse me.
You know what these burritos do to me.
But l love them! Are you gonna be all right for the game tonight, Son? Yeah.
Yeah, Dad.
No, l'll be fine.
l just hope you don't mind because this is my third.
And l probably shouldn't have gone con queso.
You know what l'm saying? You know, come to think of it, l do have some paperwork l need to catch up on.
Maybe you could find somebody else to go with you.
But, Dad, it's supposed to be just the two of us.
There's no one else l'd rather share this experience with.
Lucky me.
But, hey, if you don't really want to go, l mean, l could probably find somebody.
Lakers rule! So, what time are we leaving? Hey, maybe Thor would like to go.
-Jackson? -What? What? lt's like fate! Him just showing up here like l invited him, which, of course, l didn't! l get it.
You want me to lie.
Mr Stewart, is it okay if l lie in your house? All right, fine.
l l invited Thor first, but then you went all ''my boy'' on me, and he brought over that basketball deathcake.
l gained five pounds just looking at the thing! -Now, hold on, son.
-No, l know.
l know, Dad, l screwed up and l'm sorry.
l'm a terrible person.
Look, l don't even deserve to go to this game.
Why don't you guys just take the tickets? Son, l screwed up and l'm sorry.
You don't have to yell at me.
l mean, l'll just watch the game on Tv and You're sorry? They were your tickets.
l invited myself.
And l'll tell you what, you were just trying not to hurt the old man's feelings and that means more to me than any old silly basketball game.
l'll just let you guys have your father-and-son moment.
So beautiful.
Okay.
l know what you're thinking, but that was not me.
Welcome to The Teen Court.
Today, we hear the case of ''Dissed, Dumped and Dateless.
'' First, let's meet our defendant, Matt Marshall, high school sophomore and alleged dumper.
And now our dumpee is entering the courtroom.
You're going down, pal.
-Save it for the judge.
-Right.
All rise for the honourable Judge Joe Barrett.
Thank you, Big D.
When l first read this case, l pushed it to the top of my docket.
You want to know why? Because l've got a daughter, hotshot.
Yeah.
Slam dunk, baby.
Now, sweetheart, it says here that you're suing for the cost of a dress, hair and makeup.
-ls that true, darling? -Don't forget the shoes.
-Tears.
-And mani-pedi.
This girl got a mani-pedi for you? -l can explain.
-You'll have your chance.
l have to say that.
He's got no chance.
Now, tell me what happened, angel.
My friend's too upset to speak, so she asked me to plead her case.
-Go on and proceed, baby girl.
-Thank you.
Your Honour, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, what would this country be if men didn't keep their promises? What if George Washington promised to cross the Delaware, but didn't because it was a little chilly outside? What if Abraham Lincoln promised to save the Union, but broke that promise 'cause he wanted to buy a new hat? What if Rutherford B.
Hayes Yo, Tina Talks-a-lot, come here.
l know what you're thinking.
How does she do it without any notes? Well l'll tell you what l'm thinking.
lf somebody doesn't get food dumped on them in the next five minutes, then my audience is going to dump me.
And if Joe gets dumped, Joe can't pay for his big boat.
And Joe likes his big boat.
Got it.
Okay, so you asked her out, you stood her up and you broke her heart.
And now all we want to know is, why? Why? Why? Why? -Big boat! -l'm done.
Now, before l pronounce you guilty, do you have anything to say? Your Honour Come on, come on, he hasn't got all day! This isn't fair.
l only changed my mind.
She changed her Everything.
l asked out this really cool skater girl, and the next day, she's all girly and frilly and weird.
l mean, ''Save it for the dance.
'' Where'd that come from? She just wasn't the girl l had a crush on.
-You had a crush on me? -Yeah.
-ls this true? Did you change? -Well, she made me.
Everything seems to come back to you.
Well, l was just trying to turn her into a ninth-grader.
l mean, you should've seen the way she looked before.
-l liked the way she looked before.
-You did? What does he know? Has he ever read a teen fashion magazine? l think not! He doesn't know what he wants.
He needs to be told what he wants.
He's a boy! l'll tell you what l want.
l want to serve up some justice.
And l think l know just who l want to serve it up on.
-Serve it up! Serve it up! Serve it up! -Serve it up! Serve it up! Serve it up! -Serve it up! Serve it up! -Serve it up! Serve it up! Whoa, whoa, whoa, two seconds.
l'm begging! Thank you.
lsn't the important thing that these two wonderful kids are back together? lsn't that why we're all here? Have you ever seen this show? Look around.
Okay, l admit it.
l'm sorry.
Lilly, l should've never tried to change you.
You're great the way you are.
Totally.
-So you forgive me? -Yeah.
Sure, whatever.
Look at that.
Everybody's happy.
Looks like another Teen court case is closed.
Not quite.
Oh, boy.
Today's guilty party gets a heaping plate of spaghetti, smothered in a hearty tomato sauce and topped with plenty of squirmy, oily anchovies! That is some stinky justice! Case closed.
Where'd you get these anchovies, Joe? Fishing on your big boat? Trading two seats for three.
That was sheer genius, Son.
And getting up here was great exercise.
My lungs are on fire.
Criminy, my nose is bleeding.
So we're a little high up.
At least the sound is great.
Dad! Dad, save the popcorn! 

Nobody's perfect l gotta work it Again and again till l get it right Nobody's perfect you live and you learn it 'cause everybody makes mistakes Nobody's perfect Nobody's perfect No, no nobody's perfect Thank you! You guys rock! Keep on listening, and l'll see you guys when l get back from my very first European tour! l know! l can't wait.
Swiss chocolate, ltalian shoes and French boys! The closest she's coming to Paris is Paris, Texas.
Thank you, guys! l'll see you all next time.
Bye! Nailed it! And now, for the main event, the big toe! Dang it, Jackson, l hate toenail day! Hey, l put a note on the refrigerator.
lf you choose not to wear your protective goggles, l can't be held responsible.
Well, here's something you can be held responsible for.
Looks like this letter's from your school.
Oh, man.
Oh, boy.
Did l tell you how great your hair looks? lt's like a field of wheat.
How do you keep it so lush? lt's about Miley.
And l use a volumising mousse, but just a little dab, right here in the palm.
Sorry, Dad.
l only care if l'm in trouble.
London, England, Paris, France Watch me do the Europe dance Europe, Europe, Europe We're all going to Europe Yeah, about that.
l just got this letter from school And somebody's grades are slipping again? Jackson, Jackson, Jackson.
What are we going to do with you, boy? -Miles, you -No, son, let her go on.
How would you handle this, Miley? Well, as much as it pains me, l'd have to say, no grades, no Europe.
l'm gonna miss you, buddy.
Then again, what do l know? l'm just a kid! Have l told you your hair looks great today? l already tried field-of-wheat.
Good luck.
So lush.
come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds How could your dad cancel the European tour just because of one bad grade? Well, l'm guessing it went something like, ''Bud, you're not going,'' and then something about your Uncle Earl's feet.
That's so weird.
lt's like you were there.
Look at this.
English muffins, ltalian sausages, Swiss cheese.
Why are you all taunting me? Sorry.
A little cranky, skipped breakfast.
Most important meal of the day.
Carry on.
Man, your dad's being so unfair! l already bought this beret.
See? So cute! Listen, guys, it's not my dad's fault.
We had a deal.
School always comes first, and if l can't get at least a B in biology, the closest we're going to get to Paris is French toast.
Hold up, people.
lf you need a B, all you have to do is ace the midterm tomorrow.
How did she miss that? No wonder she's flunking biology.
lf l could ace the midterm, l wouldn't have a problem, now would l? And if l stay friends with you, l'll never have chest hair, will l? So just come on over to my house after school.
l'd be more than happy to help you with your Spanish.
What does that mean? lt means we have a lot of work to do.
Thanks so much, Jackson.
l really appreciate it.
l really, really appreciate it.
-No problemo.
-Problemo.
Wait, l know this one! -Okay, we'll just go over it later.
-l can't wait.
-Hey, Thor, what's up? -Jackson, it's old Snowball.
The landlord says we got to get rid of him, and how can l do that? l love him so much.
l mean old Snowball, not the landlord.
Although he seems very nice.
-l need a hug! -Whoa, whoa, whoa! Dude, in California, when a guy says, ''What's up?'' the other guy says, ''Not much.
'' And then we move on.
Thor, you dumb bunny.
-Okay, let's try it again.
-Okay, good.
-Hey, Thor, what's up? -Jackson, the landlord says Whoa, whoa, whoa! Dude! We also don't hug.
We occasionally slap butts, but only on the football field.
l owe the janitor an apology.
Look, man, if you need a place to park the old guy, he can stay at my house.
Snowball, you hear that? We found you a home! Come on, boy! What, you brought your dog to school? Snowball's not a dog.
Or a cow.
Stop showing off.
You're not fooling anyone.
Miley, we've got the plan.
But if you don't like it, it was all her idea.
-Way to sell it, Oliver.
-Sorry.
l only have one chest hair, and l need it for gym class.
Just ask the smartest kid in class to tutor you.
Are you kidding? The smartest kid in class is -How can you not get this? -l'm sorry.
lt's just your data suggests vary in the number of copies of specific DNA segments.
Exactly! This isn't brain surgery! Are you serious? You want me to ask Rico? Come on, you guys, it's not like he's the only kid with a brain in this class.
Okay, fine.
-Oh, Rico.
-Hey, bubble brain.
How's it going? Smart, funny and And dead-on about that bubble brain.
But just in biology.
Other than that, you're as sharp as a tick.
-That's ''tack.
'' -You see? Good thing you two are pretty.
Okay.
l'm just going to come right out and ask you.
-You need help in biology.
-How'd you know that? Please.
Put together the grades from your last four quizzes, and they spell Duh-Duh-Duh-F.
One of those was a Duh-Duh-Duh-plus.
Whatever.
l'll help you, if you help me in another class.
How about them apples? The genius needs my help.
So, what can l do for you? Higher.
Higher.
No, no, sorry.
Lower.
-Yeah.
That's good.
-Rico, that's where l started.
l've been standing like this for two hours.
My neck is cramping.
And this wig is really heavy! Don't worry about it.
My masterpiece is complete.
All right.
Finally.
Now -What's this? -An A-plus.
-What was l here for? -l needed someone to hold the globe.
What about this stupid outfit? That was just a little something for Rico.
l'm gonna give Rico a little something if you don't teach me some biology.
Okay, okay.
Fine.
l'll give you the secret to my success.
-But share this with no one.
-Yeah, sure, whatever, teach me.
-Okay.
-Okay.
Open the book.
-Check.
-Look at the page.
Check.
-Close the book.
-What? That's it! Good luck on the test.
You didn't teach me anything.
Don't you have a photographic memory like me? No.
Then you're on your own, toots.
Wait a minute! Come back here! Okay.
Not again! At bedtime, he loves it when you read Goodnight Moon.
But don't show him where the mouse is, just let him find it.
Dude, l got it.
Now if you don't mind, l've got myself a little study date with Becky, so You mean Becky with the bad breath? No, not her.
You mean bucktooth Becky, the human bottle-opener.
She scares me.
Although she did come in handy on that field trip.
No, no, no.
Becky from Spanish class.
-You mean brainless Becky.
-Yeah.
Brainless, bodacious Becky.
What? l'll be right there! -Use the back door.
-Okay.
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.
Dude, just get out of here already! lf he gets too cold, here's his little parka, but don't zip it up.
He likes to do it himself.
Likes to zip it himself.
Right.
You're such a good teacher.
l just have one question.
How do you say ''kiss me'' in Spanish? That's easy.
That's -Bucktooth Becky.
-What? -Just ignore him.
-Okay.
Becky with the bad breath.
Why is he saying that? He's a bird.
He just repeats what he hears.
Shut up! Well, so where'd he hear it? -Brainless Becky.
Brainless Becky.
-What? No, no, l l didn't say that.
l said, ''Brainless, bodacious Becky.
'' -Excuse me? -Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye is right.
You blew it, jerk.
-No, wait! You don't understand! ''Bodacious'' is Spanish for ''smart.
'' From the Latin root braindacious.
l want my mullet back My messy cage and my 8-track My swinging perch and my water bowl Now Rob and Snowball gonna rock and roll Dad! Could you keep it down in there? l'm trying to study.
l'm sorry, honey.
All right, Snowball, we gonna take five, but when l get back, l'm teaching you Wanna Be Your Joe.
-Robby rocks.
-And don't you forget it.
l love that bird.
Ribs attach to sacrum No, no, no.
Sternum, which attaches to a bone that ends in ''illa'' or Or ''uno'' or ''Oprah.
'' Yeah, that's it, it's my Oprah, and l'm a doprah who's never going to Europa! Now hang in there, honey.
You'll get it.
No, l won't.
The biology midterm's tomorrow.
There's 206 bones in the human body.
lt's not like l can learn them like some new Hannah dance.
Yeah, you do pick up on those pretty fast.
Yeah, that's 'cause it's fun.
-Trust me, biology ain't.
-lsn't.
l'm getting a B in English, Dad, that's not the problem.
The problem is, is my biology teacher doesn't stand in front of the class going Tibia, fibula, clavicle, rib We call this the humerus and that's no fib -Why can't it be that easy? -That's a good question.
-l thought of it first! -l thought of it first! -No, you didn't! -No, you didn't! -Yes, l did.
-Didn't.
-Did! -Didn't! Yes, he did.
Yes, he did.
Like l said, l love that bird.
And now l take it home with the parietal bone lt might be crazy but l learn that way Temporal and frontal, too and now l'm finally through That make 206 l found a way that clicks We're going to England We're going to France We're going to Europe Because she learned how to memorise all the stuff Now word Bodacious Becky.
Bodacious Becky.
Bodacious Becky.
This is exactly why you're going back to Thor's, you stupid birdbrain! -Morning, Stewart.
-Stupid birdbrain.
Detention, Stewart.
lt wasn't even me, it was You know what? Why don't you just drop dead? Oh, no! What did l do? Come on, buddy.
Speak to me.
Say something.
Anything! Becky has bad breath? l was going to give you another chance, you jerk! Oh, no, no! No, wake up! Come back to me, man.
Don't fly into the light! Hey, buddy.
What's Snowball's cage doing here? l brought him to school 'cause l've just grown so fond of him.
-You got him in there? -Yeah.
He was cold.
How you doing in there, buddy? Great.
Bye.
Okay.
l was going to bring him back to you 'cause he ruined my date, and then he got me detention, but then l yelled at him, and then the next thing l knew it was bye-bye, birdie.
You're playing dead again, aren't you? Aren't you, you silly little bird? Ta-da.
Sweet niblets, l've been punk'd by a parrot.
Who does Daddy love? -Snowball! -Yes, l do.
All right, class.
Eyes on your own paper.
No talking.
-Oken? -Yes, ma'am.
-l said no talking! -Right! You have 45 minutes.
Good luck, everyone.
Done! Here you go, teach.
Sorry l took so long, l just wanted to double-check my answers.
Don't worry, lollipop.
You can always marry money.
Okay, here we go.
Question number one.
''Name the three bones that make up the arm.
'' All right, that's the humerus, the radius and the Hey, no problem, Miley, just dance it out.
When l milk the cows on Uncle Earl's farm l use the ulna bone that is in my arm Moo-ya! Stewart, are you sending signals? l won't have cheating in my class! l'm not cheating.
Really, l'm just taking the test.
Well, then take it without all this.
-But l -Will be glad to, Miss Kunkle.
Took the words right out of your mouth, didn't l? Yes, ma'am.
Yanked them out like a hungry raccoon in a doughnut shop Dumpster.
A lot of people must find those country sayings charming.
l'm from Detroit.
We don't find anything charming.
Now sit still.
l'm dead.
There.
See what you can do about that.
The Karkovski Entrapment.
Clever, Rico.
But not clever enough when you're dealing with Rico! Miss Kunkle, could you please ask the Rico twins to be quiet? Some of us are still trying to finish our test.
Actually, Stewart, it's only you.
You have two minutes left.
No pressure, 1 :58 Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Thank you.
She can't do it without dancing.
We have to distract Kunkle.
Way ahead of you.
You want a paper-cut, bit-my-tongue, or a nosebleed? Nosebleed is my favourite.
Well, lean back because you're in the splashing zone.
Oh, man! lt's a nosebleed! -lt's a gusher! -lt's a gusher, that's what it is.
-Look, everyone, it's a gusher! -Oken, Oken, honestly! Paper cuts, bitten tongues and now nosebleeds.
We should put you in a helmet.
With the parietal bone it might be crazy -Stewart! -Leg cramp.
l just need to, you know, shake it off with some dance steps.
That's it.
l warned you about cheating.
Your test is over.
But l'm not cheating.
l know the answers, and l can prove it if l can move it.
l suggest you move it down to the principal's office.
Just go down the hall, make a left, then a right, when you see your brother, you're there.
Everybody knows the bones just had to find a way Everybody knows what l'm talking about That's how l'll get an A -Stewart, l thought l told you -Just give her a chance! Please.
My bod has many parts and this is where it starts Phalanges, l have ten and metatarsals then l got some tarsals, too l'll put them in my shoe She's telling the truth The fibula is next according to my text Then comes the tibia that ain't no fib-ia And now l'm up to my knee yeah, yeah, yeah That's the patella to me We're doing the bone dance you study the answers Again and again until l get it right We're doing the bone dance you dance and you learn it And we won't mess up this test We'll get it perfect Come on, everybody! Move those femurs.
Yeah, by the look of these tests, you losers need all the help you can get.
We're doing the bone dance you dance and you learn it And now l take it home with the parietal bone lt might be crazy but we learn that way Temporal and frontal, too and now we're finally through That makes 206 l found a way that clicks Bone thugs in the house We're doing the bone dance you study the answers Again and again until l get it right We're doing the bone dance you dance and you learn it And we won't mess up this test We'll get it perfect Word! That's it, Stewart! -l'm going to get the principal.
-What? l want you to show him that dance.
lt's the best study technique l've ever seen! By the way you got an A Word! -We're going to Europe! -We're going to Europe! Give me some metacarpal love! We're doing the bone dance Study the answers What? That song.
Those moves.
Your voice.
lt all reminds me of some famous singer.
Kelly Clarkson? Hilary Duff? Jay-Z! l got it! Hannah Montana! Hannah Montana! You old joker, you're so You're right, what was l thinking? This bubble brain could never pull off something like that.
Yeah, what were you thinking? We're talking nothing upstairs, if you know what l mean.
Yeah, look.
Oliver, hey, l can see you! -l can see you, too.
Hi, Lilly.
-Hey! 

Life's what you make it So let's make it rock Let's celebrate it Join in, everyone You decide 'cause life's what you make it Life is what you make it Thank you.
l love you, too.
Good night, everybody.
Hannah! Hannah! You guys want more? Ya'll are awesome.
l'll sing all night long if you want me to.
Let's kick it, guys.
You want some toast? l'll bet you do Please add some jam and butter, too We're out of grape So sad lt's all your fault, you bad dad -You know what, Son? -Yeah, Dad? You got nerve.
There she is, six encores, the voice that wouldn't stop.
Well, they were just such a great audience They were such a great audience -Well, this isn't good.
-Here, try some of this.
Life's what you make it Help me.
come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds Do, re, mi, fa, so not working.
And it won't work if you keep talking.
You know, honey, this used to happen to me all the time when l was out on tour.
And the only thing that would help was when your mama made me stop -and not talk for a while.
-l could do that.
-Mile? -What? -You're talking.
-Dang.
Dang! There you go.
Now, listen, keep it like that, or we're gonna have to cancel the big concert on Tv Saturday.
That's a girl.
Now, if you need to say anything for the next couple of days, just use that.
Hannah Montana has never cancelled a concert before, and she's not about to start now.
l know that would just break your heart.
And when your heart breaks, baby sis, so does mine.
''You got a hot date for the concert, don't you, Jerkson?'' -Dad.
-She wrote it.
l can't believe you think that l'm that selfish that l'd put my own -What's her name, Son? -Jenny.
And she's a total babe.
So put a cork in it, froggy.
l got a lot riding on this.
Use the pad.
Couldn't have said it better myself.
Miley, l know you wanna get better, but sucking on those lollipops isn't gonna do anything but rot your teeth.
Miley, release.
Fine.
You leave me no choice.
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.
Wow, a week without talking.
You know, that's gotta be tough for a girl.
Now guys, we're different.
l don't need to talk.
l can not talk for a month, wouldn't bother me at all.
But, girls.
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
''Hey, Sally, nice capris.
'' ''l love your purse.
'' Now, that's just rude.
Miley, l know this is gonna be hard, but you just have to stop fighting it.
And don't worry, we're gonna be right here for you until you get your voice back.
-Hey, Lilly, you wanna catch a few? -Oh, yeah.
Please.
Thank you.
You know, this is nice.
Just sitting here enjoying the sun, the beach, the fresh air.
That's the thing about nature, it is just so quiet and peaceful.
Not like the constant noise you get when you're in the city.
Pull the vehicle over.
Pull l know, it drives me crazy, too.
-Hey, Oliver.
-What up, Dex? Hey, Miley.
Feeling better? Great.
So, maybe if you're not busy Friday night we could go to the movies or something.
l got this one for you.
ln your dreams, Poindexter.
We're playing hard to get.
Okay, what she meant was, ''Movies, shmovies.
'' You should plant one on her right now, big boy.
Will you make up your mind? You know, we're sending Dex mixed signals.
And he's Maybe another time.
''Four score and seven years ago'' is the beginning of what famous speech? Finger on my hand, find the smartest in the land.
Keep sliding, Oken, l can still see you.
Miley, make me smiley.
l got this one for you.
Miley's answer is the Bettysburg Address.
l think she means Betty Burg's address.
Who's Betty Burg? What? The only other thing on here is ''l heart Dex,'' and l'm not gonna say that with him sitting right there.
Okay, it'll be one week in exactly three, two, one.
Speak.
Darling, l know you're scared.
But we gotta find out sooner or later.
Dad's right, Miles.
Miles? Great, now she can't hear either.
You are falling apart just when Jenny and l need you the most.
-That is so like you.
-Would you shut it already? l'm nervous enough, and l don't know if l can l can talk.
Yeah.
lt's so good to hear your voice again.
''l heart Dex''? The last thing you wanna do is overwork it.
''Betty Burg's address''? Man, did you make her look dumb.
-''Plant one on her right now, big boy''? -Like you weren't thinking it.
Okay, now we know Miley can talk.
Let's see if Hannah can sing.
Don't let no small frustration Ever bring you down No, no, no, no Just take a situation And turn it all around With a new attitude everything can change Make it how you want it to be Staying mad, why do that? Give yourself a break Laugh about it and you'll see Life's what you make it So let's make it rock Make it rock, yeah Life's what you make it So come on -come on -come on, everybody now Jenny, isn't the concert wonderful? What's that? You bad girl.
Life's what you make it So let's make it rock Life's what you make it So come on come on l'm sorry, Miley.
This problem's not going to go away on its own.
lf you ever wanna sing again, l'm afraid you're going to need surgery.
Surgery? Really? Trust me, we're talking about a very minor operation.
l could do it blindfolded.
l won't.
l'm just saying that l could.
Not that you'd know.
l mean, you'd be out cold.
Doesn't that make you feel better? lt doesn't, does it? l should stop now.
You think? l'm sorry.
l'm just trying to reassure you that this surgery is no big deal.
One hour in my office, one week in recovery, -and you'll be as good as new, okay? -Okay.
Really, l mean, the chances of anything going wrong and you permanently losing your singing voice are one in a million.
Oh, boy.
One in a million? Well, what if l'm that one? Doc, you were this close.
Well, when l say one in a million, it's just a figure of speech.
l haven't done anywhere near that many.
Not that l haven't done a lot, because l have.
l'm going.
Daddy, there was a one in a million chance you'd be a rock star, and that happened.
There was a one in a million chance l'd be a pop star, and that happened.
Face it, this family's one in a million central.
Hey, Mile, l really think you're overreacting.
This guy's one of the best surgeons in the country.
Yeah, Dad's right.
Besides, what do you think's gonna happen? Just as the surgery's about ready to start, a meteor hits a bus.
The bus drives into a hotdog stand, a giant neon wiener flies into the power lines, the lights go off in the operating room, and the next thing you know, you're spending the rest of your life singing like Aunt Pearl after she swallowed that kazoo.
Remember? Oh, no.
l'm never gonna be Hannah Montana again all because of a giant wiener.
Here you go, Miley.
l want you to open this one next.
Yes, just what l wanted.
Now l can be just like Daddy.
Let's hear something.
Rock, rock, rock Yeah, yeah, yeah Rock, rock, rock Oh, yeah l love you, Tennessee.
Good night.
Drive careful.
Did you hear that, babe? This little girl might just end up giving you a run for your money.
Well, maybe one day l might just have to take you up on stage with me.
Encore, encore, encore.
Jingle bells, Jackson smells from 1 5 miles away -l'm gonna get you, runt.
-Help! Hey, no running in the house.
-He did it.
-She did it.
Don't you just love christmas? Hey, Mile.
l made you a cup of my famous loco hot cocoa with little marshmallows so you don't choke-o.
Choke-o.
Choke-o.
l'm gonna keep saying it until you laugh.
Choke-o.
Daddy, what if something goes wrong in the surgery, and l can't be Hannah Montana any more? Well, then, l guess you'll just have to pack your bags and get out.
Baby, that's not gonna happen.
Everything's gonna be fine.
The only thing you need to worry about is what flavour ice cream you're gonna be scarfing down after it's over.
How do you know that? 'Cause there's some things in life a daddy just knows.
Like, l know the sun's gonna come up tomorrow morning.
l know Uncle Earl's never gonna be an underwear model.
And l know your voice is gonna be fine.
You get some rest now, bud.
-Good night, Dad.
-Night.
-Love you.
-Love you.
Miley! Where is that useless freeloader? Right here, Daddy.
l thought l told you to iron these socks.
You know how l like a nice crease in my hosiery.
Sorry, Daddy, l'm still cleaning the oven.
Wait a minute, what's that on the corner of your mouth? Have you been eating the burnt bits off the broiler pan again? Sorry, Daddy.
l'm just so hungry.
Month-old trout skin, my favourite.
Well, quit stuffing your face and get to ironing.
Just because that surgery caused you to lose your singing voice doesn't mean you can lay around here licking up trout drippings like the Queen of Sheba.
But l can sing, Daddy.
l've been practising.
Listen.
This is the life Don't ever do that again.
Okay.
Now, there's only person in this house that can sing, and we all know who that is.
Jingle bells, Miley smells from 50 miles away, yeah Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Bucky Kentucky.
Thank you.
Thank you.
But Jackson could never sing.
And Bucky Kentucky? That's the dumbest name l've ever heard.
You're just jealous 'cause you don't have a state that rhymes with your name any more, little miss nobody.
Please, like anyone would ever be a fan of Bucky Kentucky.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.
lt's Bucky Kentucky! -lt's Bucky Kentucky! -Dude, dude, dude, dude, you rock! l love you! Guys, what are you doing? lt's Jackson.
-l'm sorry, did you hear something? -Yeah.
lt sounds like a washed-up pop star.
Let's go kids, or we're gonna be late for Bucky's big concert.
-The limo's waiting.
-Last one in is a Miley.
Guys, what about me? l should be going to the concert, too.
l was Hannah Montana once.
Please don't treat me like this.
l have feelings.
l'm not a piece of furniture.
Guys.
l'm not a piece of furniture.
Okay, maybe l am.
Hang on, kids.
l've just gotta grab my keys and my wallet.
There they are.
Daddy, what happened to me? l'm nothing but a table.
Honey, you're much more than that.
You're also a coat rack.
Sweet niblets.
We'd love to take you along with us, Mile, but you just got too many hang-ups.
-Hey, that's a good one, Daddy.
-See, l told you l was funny.
No, don't leave.
Somebody help me.
Please.
Baby girl, you always did have the strangest dreams.
Mama? Mom, it is you.
Sorry.
Your daddy gave you some of his loco hot cocoa before bed again, didn't he? He knows what sugar does to you.
l swear, when l'm finished here, l'm popping in to one of his dreams.
He is gonna get an earful.
Not helping.
lt's your dream, sweet pea.
lf you don't like it, all you have to do is change it.
lt's not that easy.
Hey, maybe it was.
Where were you when l was eating trout skin? All right, baby girl, we both know you didn't dream me here to ask me that.
Now why don't you tell me what's really on your mind? l lost my voice.
And if it doesn't come back, then -Then -Miley, do you really think if you're not Hannah Montana, you're no better than a piece of furniture? Look at that thing.
l swear, there is nothing more dangerous than your daddy with a pocket full of cash and one of Uncle Earl's garage sales.
Mom, if l can't sing, then l'm just l'm just Miley.
And what in the world is wrong with that? l think just Miley is pretty darn terrific.
And l know that she is strong enough to handle anything.
-She is? -Heck, yeah.
That's the way your daddy and l raised you.
You're a wonderful girl, and that's why your friends love you so much.
What friends? You saw the way they treated me.
For heaven's sake.
Lilly, Oliver, get in here.
lf she wasn't Hannah Montana, would you still be her friends? Are you kidding? Of course we would.
Miley, you were my best friend way before l knew you were Hannah Montana.
Then why'd you all just walk out on me? -lt's your dream.
-lt's your dream.
And it was only scary because you're so worried about that surgery tomorrow.
lt's true, Miles.
ln real life, l sing like a starving walrus.
Mom, this is where you say, ''No, you don't, honey.
'' No, you don't, honey.
Just a regular walrus.
-A cute, tone-deaf walrus.
-Thanks.
-l like your mom.
She's funny.
-She's pretty, too.
That's it.
You're out of here.
Hey, why am l leaving? l don't wanna go.
Stop! This is not fair! The point is, whether you're Hannah Montana or just Miley, you're still gonna be the annoying, obnoxious little sister.
That l love.
-Okay, you can wake up anytime now.
-l ain't done yet.
You see, no matter what happens to your voice, you have the most important thing a person can have.
-People who care about you.
-You're right, Mommy.
You think? What the heck? Oliver, get back in here.
Thank you.
You were loved before you were Hannah Montana, and you'll be loved long after Hannah's on one of those ''Where Are They Now'' shows.
l think you're confusing me with Dad.
l am not worried about you one bit.
-l miss your hugs, Mom.
-Baby girl, they're never far away.
All you have to do is think about me.
Now, listen, say goodbye to your friends and get some sleep.
You did good, honey.
You're doing a pretty good job yourself.
Except for that hot chocolate before bed.
Yeah, about that.
l know you always told me not to do that, but this was a very emotional Miley, you can wake up now.
Robby Ray, how many times do l have to tell you? Miley, wakey, wakey.
l cannot believe you still have that table.
No wonder the girl's having nightmares.
l'm sorry, darling.
You know l always was a pushover.
That you were.
'cause it's you and me together Don't be scared, baby girl.
The surgeon did a wonderful job.
Your voice sounds better than ever.
Come on.
l'm always on your side No one, no one, no one can ever change it come on, let 'em try -'cause it's you and me together now -You and me together now -Jackson, cut it out, boy.
-Hey, it's your dream.
Not this time.
Well, if it's not your dream, and it's not mine, then whose is it? l think l know.
Mama was right about that hot chocolate.

We have got some serious work to do, my friend.
Yo, Jackson, get out of the shower! You're using up all the water! Too bad! You snooze, you lose! Who's the loser now? Okay, sister, it's on! Oh, yeah, and so is this.
And this is on.
Oh, yeah.
Cold, cold, cold! Good, good, and Not so good.
This is all your fault.
How am l supposed to rinse and repeat? Here's your rinse.
Do you want to repeat? Good news.
l got the girl's bathroom working, and the boy's bathroom should be done in about three weeks.
Three weeks? That's not good news.
lt is for me.
Now l can finally get that tummy tuck, and just in time for swimsuit season.
-Chicks'll be digging that.
-Yes, they will.
Three weeks? What am l supposed to do about this? Look for a carnival.
You're finally tall enough to ride the bumper cars.
''Ring!'' Hello? lt's the Bride of Frankenstein.
She wants her hair back.
That's it.
l've heard about enough.
-But it's her fault.
-lt's his fault.
lt's both of your fault.
That's the reason why, from now on, until the bathroom gets fixed, you're both gonna be sharing Miley's.
Daddy say what? This is so unfair.
She started it.
You know what? We can get her a cat box, put it out on the deck, everybody wins! Son, l want you to go sit on the couch, think about what you're gonna say next, and then don't say it.
-But -Think.
Now go.
Why can't he just share yours? Because, honey, that would deny you two the wonderful opportunity to learn how to work together.
Besides, let's face it, the boy's a pig.
come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds My eyes! What have you done to my bathroom? Just a little reorganisation.
My shaving stuff? ln this fancy new holder.
You're using one of my bras? Actually, l'm using two of your bras.
The other one's holding my hair stuff.
Check it out.
You could market these puppies.
You could call them the bra basket.
The bra-sket.
That cat box is looking better and better.
-Are those my good tweezers? -Yeah, and they work great.
No! l finally got you, Stan! Stan? You name your nose hairs? Just the really tough ones.
Daddy! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! lt burns! lt burns! Get it off! lt burns! lt burns! Daddy! Gross! -Stop it.
Jackson, l have to spit.
-Me, too.
Oops.
Daddy! Jackson, may l please bother you for a comb? Of course, and it's no bother at all, sister dear.
Thank you.
That's more like it.
Now, you guys keep it up.
l gotta go apply my sculpting gel before l go all frizzy.
Get out of the way.
You're blocking the mirror.
lt's my mirror, and l'll block it if l want to.
Stop it.
Sweet niblets! Family meeting now! -This is all your fault! -This is all your fault! No.
Look at this.
lt's a crime.
What am l supposed to do about this? l'm thinking it's a hat day.
l'm thinking you don't want to know what l'm thinking.
l'm thinking you're right.
Now let me tell you two a story about my days in the band.
Here we go.
We know, Dad.
You had a backup singer named Celine Dionowitz.
You told her to shorten her last name.
-And the rest -is history.
That is a true story.
But are we talking about that right now? No.
We're talking about the fact that you two can't learn to get along.
She spit on my neck.
l almost wiped my face with his underwear.
Daddy, l'm gonna live with that for the rest of my life.
Hush up.
Now, listen.
Me and the band lived on that bus for a year.
Five guys, one bathroom, and somebody always ate a little too much barbecue.
-But you know how we fixed it? -You opened all the windows? Yes, as a matter of fact, we did, but we also learned to get along by seeing life through the other person's eyes.
And that's exactly what you two are gonna do.
Oh, no, here comes Dr Phillbilly.
Now, Miley, l want you to pretend to be Jackson.
And, Jackson, you pretend to be Miley.
Sure, give him the good part.
Gee, l only hope that l can do it justice.
Hi, l'm Miley.
Now l'm Hannah.
Now l'm Miley.
l'm a real girl.
l'm a pop star.
Everybody makes mistakes Everybody has those days Except for me because l'm perfect! Your turn.
My pleasure.
Girls, cars, nose hairs.
Good day! l said good day, Daddy! Now, l don't know about you, but l feel much, much better.
All right, that's it.
lt's time for Dr Phillbilly to kick it up a notch.
Now, the year that Uncle Earl bought Aunt Pearl a mulch maker for valentine's Day, they had to go to a marriage counsellor.
And he dressed them up like Oompa-Loompas? He said they needed a safe way to work out their anger so they could finally sit down and talk with each other.
Dad, l thought you said that violence is never the answer.
lt's not.
But if this little exercise helps you all get to a safe place of genuine love and communication, then whack away.
-l'm not hitting a girl.
-Good, then this should be fun.
Come on.
Okay.
Now you've done it.
l am so gonna Come on, butterball.
ls that the best you can Okay, you guys ready to really sit down and talk now? -l guess not.
-Get off me, blubber butt! ln your dreams, Hannah Fatannah! Move it.
-l was here first.
-Well, l was born first.
Don't you mean ''hatched''? You two are hopeless.
lf you're gonna act like kids, then l'm gonna treat you like kids.
You're both grounded.
What? Daddy, l have Beyoncé's big party tonight, and she told me that Chris Brown totally wants to meet Hannah.
Well, Chris is just ''totally'' gonna have to wait.
Come on, Daddy.
l mean, can't you just ground Miley? l mean, Hannah didn't do anything! Here it comes, ''l'm Miley.
l'm Hannah.
l'm Miley.
l'm Hannah.
'' Shut up.
You know what? You're not the only one who has a life.
Dad, l'm taking Siena to Panic at the Disco.
Siena Grace? She's a cutie.
l know.
Well, too bad.
Nobody's going anywhere except me, to go upstairs and take a hot bath and try to remember the good old days before you two could talk.
Way to go, Jackson.
Now l'm never gonna meet Why are you smiling? We just got grounded.
True.
But l just thought of a way to un-ground us.
Now, follow me.
l'm getting real tired of this.
l heard all the quiet and l got nervous.
Everything okay in here? Y'all keep this up and the grounding'll be over before you know it.
This is never gonna work! Maybe not.
But on the bright side, my pores are all tingly.
Jackson, you're a genius and my hero.
Until we get back home.
Then l hate you again.
Right back at you.
Now, careful with the makeup.
l promised Thor we wouldn't mess up his truck.
Oh, yeah.
l'd hate to get blush on his half-eaten hoagie.
Just stop complaining.
You know that we couldn't take my car without tipping off Dad, and l call dibs.
Oh, yeah, that Siena Grace is one lucky girl.
Jackson, are you sure we're going the right way? l think we missed our turn.
There's no turn.
l would've seen a turn.
How can you see anything with this fog? Face it, we're lost.
We are not lost.
We're just not there yet.
-Stop nagging me, woman.
-l'm not nagging you.
Deer! -Whatever you say, honey.
-No, deer! Nice going, Ricky Bobby.
You could've driven us off a cliff.
But l didn't because l have lightning reflexes and l am cool in the crunch.
-Daddy! -Daddy! Don't come in, Daddy.
Y'all.
l'm sicker than a possum in a possum hospital.
Y'all.
Relax.
lt's me.
And by the way, if Mr Stewart comes up, don't talk.
What are you doing? We're supposed to stay in our rooms until they get back.
l know, but listen.
Wow, their plumbing really is messed up.
That's my stomach.
l'm starving.
Well, too bad.
lf we go downstairs, we might run into Mr Hey, Mile? -What do we do? -Hide! Not here! Get out.
Dinner's on the table.
You all right, darling? Hey, l know you're upset about not getting to go to that party, but you still gotta eat.
So, l grilled up your favourites, Robby Ray's hot ee-doggies.
Not hungry.
Really? You sure do sound hungry.
You want me to bring you up a snack? Hey, darling, there ain't no sense laying up here being sad.
Remember what used to make you happy when you was a little girl? camptown ladies sing this song Come on, darling, you got to ''doo-dah'' with your daddy.
Alone now.
Girl stuff.
Y'all.
Okay.
Well, if you get to feeling better, come on downstairs.
Really, honey, there'll be other parties.
That's it.
Next time he comes up, you're under the bed.
-Honk for help.
Honk for help.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
l know.
l would have thought of that.
Great, looks like the only help we're gonna be getting is from a lonely bull.
-How far down is it? -How should l know? Well, look out the window.
Not like that.
Well, l'm sorry l didn't bring my extendo-neck.
Okay.
Okay, look.
This is all about weight distribution.
lf we crawl out the back, then the truck can't tip.
Okay.
l'll go first.
l should go first because l'm heavier.
Yeah, but l'm faster, which means l can get to my party quicker, and then, you know, come back and With help for you.
l cannot believe how selfish you're being.
l'm not being selfish.
l'm thinking of my millions of fans.
-They'd be crushed if l died.
-Hey, people would miss me, too.
Oh, please.
Your teachers would throw a party, Thor would be too upset about his truck, and, trust me, l can get Daddy through it.
-Flip a coin? -Good idea.
Heads.
-Two out of three? -Sure, why not? That's right.
'Cause it'd be stupid! -What? -My belt's caught.
Look, just Just try to grab something and pull yourself through.
l can't.
There's nothing but this rubber fish.
Oh, no.
Not rubber.
Okay.
Look, l'm just gonna come around, and l'm gonna pull you out.
-What? No! -Don't worry.
The weight of your big head will keep us balanced.
Okay, l'll distract him.
You get the food.
-Right.
-But only mustard on my ee-doggie.
The regular kind, not the fancy kind.
-Got it.
-Okay.
But not too much.
l don't wanna overpower the dog.
Unless there's relish.
That changes everything.
Would you just go.
Fine.
Okay, l'm going.
Well, Lilly.
This is a surprise.
-You know Miley's grounded.
-l know.
l'm here to see you.
-Really? -Yeah.
lt turns out my Uncle Will is a big Robby Ray fan, and l was wondering if l could get your autograph for him.
Sure.
Come on in.
Let me just grab a pen.
Slow down there, cowboy.
l'm way ahead of you.
l brought Uncle Will's special autograph book.
There's nothing in it.
That's because you're his first.
How special is that? Well, come on in while l sign it.
But it's such a beautiful night.
Perfect autograph weather.
Let's not spoil it.
All right.
Should l make it out to Will or Uncle Will? Actually, Uncle Willhelm von Kieran Garden State.
Not so much! pressure on the pen.
Wouldn't want to poke a hole in Uncle Willhelm von Kieran Garden State's special pad.
Here you go, Lilly.
Why don't you read it and make sure it's okay? Okay.
''Dear Lilly and Oliver'' Oh, boy.
Keep going.
lt gets better.
''How dumb do y'all think l am? ''Love, Robby Ray.
'' l like the ''love'' part.
Hey, Oliver.
What's the matter, son? Ee-doggie's got your tongue? l'm out.
l'm free! Jackson.
Dang it.
Okay.
-What's wrong? -Nothing.
Nothing, it's just a bird.
lt's not like it's gonna tip the truck.
lt's all good.
Okay, not so good.
-Jackson, it's not working.
Just jump.
-No way.
l am not leaving you here.
-Don't be stupid.
-Don't argue with me! Look, we're gonna be okay.
We just have to work together.
-And fast.
-Okay, l'll suck in, you pull.
-Okay.
One, two, three, go.
-One, two, three, go.
-Yes.
We did it.
-Now, let's get out of here.

-lt must have caught on something.
Yeah, ground.
Nice cliff.
What is that, like 2 feet? Hey, 2 feet or 200 feet, you still didn't leave me.
Yeah, l know.
-What was l thinking? -Shut up.
Well, now, l guess we should probably go look for some help.
-Yeah, let's go.
The road's this way.
-No, Miles, it's this way.
No, it's this way.
-You know what? Whatever you say.
-No, no, no.
Whatever you say.
l think this is gonna be harder than we thought.
-No, it won't.
-Yeah, it will.
All in all, last night turned out pretty well.
Everybody's safe, and l think you finally learned the benefits of working together.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah, Dad, we learned our lesson.
camptown ladies sing this song Doo-dah, doo-dah camptown racetrack 5 miles long All the doo-dah day l do love being a ''doo-dah'' daddy.

Wow.
Would you look at that? l know.
Lilly's the queen of backwash.

This is a big moment for Lilly, and if you had a romantic bone in your body, you'd be able to see that.
Hey, l have eyes.
Okay, look.
He just said something funny.
She laughed.
Big whoop.
She's not laughing 'cause he's funny.
She's laughing 'cause he's cute.
Boy brains.
You might as well scoop them out and store nuts up there.
So girls laugh at me 'cause l'm cute.
No, girls laugh at you 'cause you nod like a chicken and you fall over things.
l do not.
Hey, what up, baby? Oh, my gosh.

Jackson, this is serious.
No, dude, you're right.

You don't get it, do you? lt's not just the sunglasses.
They've stolen Rico's honour, and this will not stand! Rico, what are you doing here so early? Just making sure my new security system works.
What security system? Rico! That new security system.
Let this be a warning to all who dare challenge the power of the mighty Rico! So, y'all excited about movie night? Yeah, and just to let you know, Dad, you are more than welcome to skoodle your boodle out of here.

That's the way a man spends Saturday night.
You really miss race car season, don't you, Daddy? Yeah.
This time of year, all they got on Tv is those stupid dance shows.
-Hi, hi.
-Hey.
What's going on? You're not in your movie jammies.
Right.
About that l mean that's a cute outfit, but it looks like you're about to go out with Lucas.
Hey, Miley, thanks for the invite.

Great, 'cause l only had enough for two.
Can l talk to you in the kitchen? Just you and me? Alone? Are you sure? Miley, you're so funny.
Look, l'm sorry, but he called at the last minute, and l told him l couldn't talk to him, but then he said, ''You are talking,'' and then l laughed, and then he laughed, and then l laughed And to think that l missed out on this yuk-fest, emphasis on the yuck.
You could've called to warn me.

Yes, but you're doing it quietly.
l cannot believe you would be this selfish.
You are the worst best friend ever.
Who's that? Special delivery from your worst best friend ever.
Come on in, Derek.
You set me up on a blind date? That is the most wonderful thing you have ever done for me.
Well, hello, there.
Hi.

Yes, you are, and l'm Miley.

''lt's in the house! lt's in the house!'' Yeah, l was picking caramel corn out of my hair for about two days.
How could Lilly do this to me? You know, she was just trying to hook you up so you didn't feel left out.
Sure, it wasn't the one-on-one time you wanted, but it was still a very caring gesture.
Wow, Oliver.
-That was insightful -Yeah.
-smart and sensitive.
-Yeah.
What happened to your boy brain? l spent last night checking out my mom's chick magazines.
l learned that l'm an autumn, capri pants are the best for my body shape, and new love, it's a bright flame that eventually dims into a warm, comfortable glow.
Well, Lucas is her first real boyfriend.
And she does seem to have achieved a new level of emotional satisfaction.
Okay, now you're seriously weirding me out.
Just talk to her at lunch.
And the velvet belt, so last season.
She hasn't said a word to me all day.
She wouldn't even look at me in English, and when she looked at me in Biology, daggers.
You've got a boyfriend who's crazy about you.
lt's gotta be tough for her.
You're so great.
l can't believe you're all mine.
Well, believe it.
You're the only one for me.
Well, aren't you a busy boy.
Lilly, l really need to talk to you.
-Come on.
-One second.
Miley, l'm really sorry about the other night, and l called you Don't worry about it.
l forgive you, but l have to tell you something.
Lucas Lucas is cheating on you.
-What? -Lucas is cheating on you.
-What? -Lucas is cheating on you.
What? And And And And You lt's true.
Yeah, tell her, Lu-kiss-every-girl-in-school.
Lilly, l feel horrible about this.
A little late in the day for that, bub.
l'm so sorry that your best friend is so threatened by our relationship, she'd lie to break us up.
That's right.
Straight from the Cheater say what? So it's not true? Of course not.
Come on, Lilly.
Who are you going to believe? That lip-lock liar or your best friend? Come on, Lucas.
Now this is why y'all don't get dates.
Hello, there.
Miley, what are you doing here? l just came to tell you, you were right.
-Really? -l was jealous.
But not of you.
Of her with you.
l want to be with you.
l want to find puffy little clouds with you.
Miley, l Miley No, no, no.
Don't speak.
Just kiss me.
No, l'll kiss you.
Hey, whoa.
Nice try, but l think you and l both know the kind of guy l really am.
What was l thinking? He is never going to hit on Lilly's best friend.
You couldn't have thought of that five minutes ago? l'm sorry.
l mean, l had to try something.
l mean, it's not like l can just put on some disguise and Boy, am l stupid.
Does anybody work here? Wow.
When you apologise, you don't fool around.
This is the coolest restaurant in town.
Well, it's the least l could do after the way l acted.
What's the deal? l've been waiting an hour for a table here.
Well, when l have a table, l'll tell you.
Really? You know what? l completely forgot, it's my little girl's birthday.
Can you help us out? Come on.
No, it isn't.
You know what? l got the wrong girl.
lt's her birthday.
How did l screw that up? Mine was two months ago.
Do you want to eat? l'm sorry, but this is what happens when Daddy calls at the last minute.
Hannah! Phillipe, l am so sorry l called at the last minute! Don't give it a second thought.
Table for Miss Montana! Are you kidding? -lt's Hannah Montana! -But he's Larry David.
He created Seinfeld and curb Your Enthusiasm.
Sorry.
Face it, Dad, she's bigger than you.
l bet Uncle Jerry could get us in.
Uncle Jerry? Why couldn't you say it was your birthday? Come on! l'm just so glad we're not fighting any more, and, you know, once you get to know Lucas, l know you guys are going to be really close friends.
l feel close to him already.
Dude, that's Hannah Montana, and she's totally checking me out.
You're kidding! Where? l'm sorry that l'm late, Lisa.
Yes, l'm leaving the shack right now.
Come on, baby.
All right, bye.
Alarm activated.

Jackson! l got the security alert.
What did they steal? All the heat in my body.
Now that is cool.
That's it, Rico.
l quit.
Let's not do anything hasty.
Here's a couple of hot dogs on me.
So warm.
And l'm gonna need you to sign these.
-What are they? -Nothing.
lt's just some release forms saying l'm not responsible for any bodily injuries, emotional trauma Rico, why are you doing this? l mean, you spent a fortune on a security system because of a $ 7 pair of sunglasses, and all it's done is kill your business and freezer-burn my butt! -lt doesn't make any sense.
-lt does to me.
l don't want anyone thinking they can take advantage of me because of my size.
l don't care how much it costs, no human being will ever rip Rico off again.
l don't think humans are your problem.
l hope he enjoys it.
That hot dog cost me $ 1 1 ,000.
l am so sorry.
Great hair.
Did you see that? That was a move.
Not just a move.
That was a hair-touch move.
You're right.
She wants me.
lt's too bad l'm going with Lilly.
l got two words for you, my brother.
Guy code.
We are men, and we are hunters, and what happens in the jungle, it stays in the jungle.
Dude, you rock.
Hey, if things work out, l'll hook you up with her friend.
Fingers crossed.
Look, Justin Timberlake's eating the same shrimp as me.
Hey, Justin.
Great shrimp, huh? -What are you doing? -Nothing.
You've got your flirty face on.
Who is he? ls it that guy, or that guy, or Lucas, or Oliver, or You're despicable! Lilly, l had to do something to show you l wasn't lying.
The only thing you've shown me is that we're no longer friends.
l am leaving, and l'm taking the shrimp.
No, no, no.
Lilly, l was just trying to protect you from getting hurt.
The only one who's hurting me is you.
You just can't accept the fact that Lucas really cares about me.
Oh, yeah? Then why is he coming over here to flirt with Hannah? He's coming over here to tell you to stop making googly eyes at him, because he has a girlfriend.
Hi, Hannah.
l'm Lucas.
l noticed you looking at me, and l Go ahead, just say it.
Yeah, tell her how you really feel.
-Well, the truth is -Excuse me, Miss Fontana.
l have your biggest fan right here.
-Grandma.
-lt's okay, sweetheart.
She's a celebrity.
This is why they go out in public.
Don't go anywhere.
This will just take a second.
-There you go, sweetie.
-Thank you.
-You were saying? -Well l have a camera right here.
Let's take pictures.
Okay.

Other way.
-There you go, Grandma.
-That's so sweet.
No, the lighting isn't good in here.
lt's better in the bathroom.
Let's go.
Come on.
-Grandma! -Grandma! Don't whine.
Just tell her what you were gonna say.
Yeah.
What was that you were gonna say? Could you just give her my number and tell her to call any time? Why? To tell her you have a girlfriend? 'Cause, you know, you look like the kind of guy who has a girlfriend he really, really likes.
-Actually l've got two.
-Two? Yeah, but l'd dump them both for Hannah.
So funny.
Well, in that case, l know Hannah would want me to give you a little something, too.
-Sweet.
-Yeah.
Yeah, it is sweet.
-You really got that boy back good.
-That was just Lola.
Wait till Lilly gets a hold of him.
Lilly, l'm really sorry.
Yeah, l'm sorry l didn't believe you.
Man, boys can really mess things up, can't they? Yeah, and you can't live with them, can't eat with them.
Well, what are we gonna do next time one of us has a boyfriend? The only thing we can do.
Trust each other.
-Deal? -Deal.
Oh, my goodness.

Lannah, be a doll, take our picture.
You know, you're not as cute in person.

Great rehearsal, you guys.
-Hey, thanks.
-Bring it on.
l can't believe we're actually going to be performing for the President of the United States.
This is so cool! Did you see that? The new guy touched me.
Didn't anybody tell him? Hello! Never touch the star.
Never, ever, ever.
Gotcha.
We do that to all the new dancers.
Hope you're not mad at me.
Try totally humiliated.
l'm so out of here.
-Jeremy.
-Gotcha back.
You're good.
Good enough to go to a movie with tonight? -l'd like that.
-Me, too.
l'm in the mood for a comedy or maybe something where Taye Diggs takes his shirt off.
Either one works for me.
Jeremy, this is my bodyguard, Roxy.
That's right, and it's my job to protect Hannah Montana from danger, all kinds of danger.
Know what l'm saying, dancer boy? l think you do.

You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar?

Mine or hers? Free refills, Taye took his shirt off twice.
l'd give it two thumbs up, but l don't wanna let go of my bucket.
Dad, he is never gonna ask me out again.
Honey, you say that about every boy you and Roxy date.
Do l even need to tell you what's wrong with that sentence? Sense of humour, that's gonna help you later in life.
Now, you are singing for the President tomorrow.
You need to get your rest, and l need to go home and find my bullet-proof pantyhose.
Keeps bullets out, keeps Roxy in.
Dad, this night was a disaster.
l'm sure it wasn't that bad.
l bet the boy had a good time.
Dad, Roxy put a bell around his arm.
So every time he tried to make a move, it went Exactly how many times did the boy ''ding''? lt doesn't matter, Daddy.
Every time he went ''ding,'' she went, ''Don't,'' and l went, ''Dang!'' Well, honey, Roxy's just doing her job.
To be honest with you, l agree with her, 'cause when it comes to girls, boys will say and do just about anything.
No, no, Julie.
l'm serious.
l am a professional motocross racer.
Heck, yeah.
l'm working on my bike right now.
Listen to that engine purr.
Julie? Julie? Man, how could she not believe me? l'm guessing you puréed when you should've liquefied.
Of course.
Dad, not all boys are like that.
l bet you didn't lie to girls.
Well, honey, when you got a head of hair like this, you don't have to.
Everybody makes mistakes Everybody has those days One, two, three, four Everybody makes mistakes Everybody has those days Everybody knows what what l'm talking about Everybody gets that way l have a visual on Montana.
Repeat, l have a visual on Montana.
Yes, l'll get her autograph, Mom.

Lola likey.
Mr President, Sophie, l'd like to introduce you to my daughter, Hannah Montana.
Hold, please.
And go.
And we're clear.
l can't believe l'm meeting Hannah Montana.
l can't believe l'm meeting America's angel.
As leader of the free world, may l say your concert was off the hook and you were the bomb? Daddy, keep it real or keep it quiet.
What? Just because l live in the White Hizzle doesn't mean l got no sizzle.
Don't worry, sweetie.
All dads are embarrassing.
Yeah, but yours never stopped a motorcade because he saw a horsey.
Now, Sophie, horses have owners and owners vote, and l got to feed him a carrot.
Don't you love it when those big, fat hairy lips just tickle the palm of your hand? That's my favourite part.
Sushi! President likey.
Watch this.
The Japanese ambassador loves this.
Roxy, what are you doing? Really, there's enough for everyone.
Enough to get you sick.
l'm sorry, sir, but what we have here is a case of fish gone funky.
Excuse me? Oh, boy.
The salmon's coming back upstream.
Amazing.
A nose like that should be working for the President of the United States.
l'm honoured, sir, but l can't leave Hannah.
-Sure you can.
-What? l mean, you cannot pass up an opportunity like this.
He's the President of the United States.
Not bad! Up top, Miss Montana! Up top, Mr Prez.
But, Roxy, your country needs your keen sense of smell.
l mean, sour milk, bad bologna? This honker is the only thing that can keep your President on the job and off the john.
l can appreciate that, but l still don't think that l should, you know Whee doggies! That's a nice outfit, Son.
l hadn't seen that much leather since your grandma got all gussied up for singles' bingo.
Dad! Dad! Dad! Now if you'll excuse me, l'm on my way to Julie's to tell her l just took fourth place in the big race.
Well, why not just tell her you won? Because this way l don't even need to show her a trophy.
Always thinking.
You see, Miley? lf l take that job, who's gonna protect you from boys who are ''always thinking''? l mean, l've had your back ever since we met down at Wig City.
No, no, no, no, no.
l don't think so.
All right, this is getting to be downright painful.
l'll be right back.
-Now we cooking with gas.
-l love it! Hey, Mile.
What do you think of this one? l'm guessing you the daddy.
Don't worry.
l'll help him next.
lt kind of looks like Aunt Pearl when she gets back from the beauty shop.
l know, and you've changed my life, too, but let's face it, Roxy.
This schnoz is bigger than the both of us.
-You want me to go, don't you? -No, l don't.
Yes, you do, 'cause l'm all up in your business.
Look me in the eye and tell me that isn't true.
Okay, fine it is.
l'm a girl.
l have needs.
Please tell me you just said you're a girl who has knees.
Roxy, it's not that l want you to go.
l don't.
l just need a little space.
Sure.
l give you a little space and something happens to you.
That's not the way Roxy rolls.
Well, l'm tired of Roxy rolling all over my life.
Hey, speaking of rolls, why don't l heat up some sweet ones? And then we can get all buttered up, and we'll sit back and be reasonable about this.
l don't need to be reasonable.
l just need to protect Hannah Montana, and if l can't do it full-out Roxy, l can't do it at all.
Well, then maybe you shouldn't.
Well, if that's the way you want it, then l'm happy to oblige.
Goodbye, Miss Montana.
l blame myself.
l should've offered up my sticky buns sooner.
lt's not your fault, Daddy.
We'll find a bodyguard better than Roxy.
One that understands my knees.
These babies, right here.
Yeah.
So, tell us something about yourself and what qualifies you to be Hannah Montana's bodyguard.
l love your music.
l love what you stand for, youth, innocence and fun, and if anybody threatens that, l'll rip their guts out and feed them to the pigeons.
l'm the bodyguard you want! l'm the bodyguard you need! Thank you, Mr Annihilator.
There's a lot of bad hombres out there looking to pump up the party.
Well, l got one question for them.
You got nerve? Well, do you, punk? Do you? Thank you, Mr Mysterious Stranger.
Well, that fits.
Let me make one thing abundantly clear, princess.
Anybody comes within spitting distance of you, we're gonna have to go for a little ride and maybe have a little conversation.
Agabish? And what l'm gonna say is, bada-bing, bada-boom, end of story, forget about it.
Thank you, Mr -There's no name here.
-You don't need to know my name.
Well, Mile, you've seen over 30 bodyguards.
-There must be one you like.
-There is, and l kept seeing her in everyone that came in.
-You miss Roxy, don't you? -Yes.
l made a mistake, Dad.
l mean, sometimes she gets on my last nerve, but she's family.
Well, the President doesn't leave town till tomorrow, so you've got time to go to the hotel and talk to her.
Come on, Dad.
She's never gonna come back after the things l said.
You never know till you try, bud.
Stranger things have happened.
You got that right.
Come on, Julie.
l swear.
l would have shown you the bike, but l crashed it.
See, here's the handlebars.
Come on, girl.
Don't walk so fast.
l'm getting a thigh rash.
Rico, do a dude a favour.
Run down to the store and get me some baby powder.
Jackson, l say this because l care.
You're pathetic! The First Daughter was so excited when you called.
Well, l thought teaching America's angel one of my songs would be a great way to serve my country.
She's such a giver.
Sophie will be here momentarily.
Until then, you have permission to play with the dolls.
lt's a lot of fun l've been told.
Okay.
While l'm waiting, l think l'm just gonna go say hi to one of my old bodyguards.
That's a negative.
-Are you sure? -That's a positive.
l have orders to keep Hannah Montana in this room.
Orders from a seven-year-old.
Tomorrow we go to Make a Moose.
Well, this is great.
Now, we're stuck in here.
No, Hannah's stuck in here.
-You don't have a clue, do you? -Not one.
Hannah, check it out! l look just like you.
Wow! You look more like me than l do.
Let's learn that new song.
Everybody makes mistakes Everybody has those days Roxy? Roxy? Roxy? Oh, boy.
There you are.
Well, you're early.
l am? Well, then why don't l just go away and come back then? Toodles! Oh, no, no, no.
l know how in demand you are.
l hear you're the finest dog whisperer on the West Coast.
Dog whisperer? Poor Humphrey.
He won't eat, and he's sadder than the vice President when he heard l passed my physical.
Can you help him, please? l'd love to, but l just got an emergency call.
Bashful beagle in Beverly Hills.
So sad.
Toodles.
Please.
You're my last hope, and l'm not asking as the President.
l'm asking as a loving dog owner, who can get you a ride on Air Force One.
Yes, Mr President.
l guess l'll just whisper to the dog.
Where's Roxy? -What's that? -Please.
Let me do my job.
l don't tell you how to run the country.
Point made.
Carry on.
Yes.
Yes.
l'll tell him.
Okay.
He's sick of his dog food.
Kibble, kibble, kibble.
Boring! You're amazing.
Can l get room service? This is the President of the United States.
Yes, l'll hold.
And so will you.
Well, look at that.
There it is.
Looks delicious.
And we're back to toodles.
See ya.
Well, no, no.
Wait a second.
He's still not eating.
Okay, okay.
Humphrey, all your favourites.
Boiled liver.
Ox tongue stew.
Yeah.
Calf-brains fricassee.
l think he knows you're faking.
You have got to be kidding me.
l'd do it myself, but l just had my teeth whitened, and l can't afford a meat stain.
l'd better get a medal out of this.
That's some good liver.
Nobody's perfect, no, nobody's perfect Are you sure you're Hannah Montana? Why, of course l am.
Why would you ask a silly question like that? l don't know.
Because you stink on ice.
Well, what do you expect? l didn't bring my lights.
l didn't bring my band.
Yeah, you didn't bring your talent, either.
l just want the Hannah Montana l saw on stage.
So do l, kid.
So do l.
Come on.
Eat, puppy, eat.
l'm begging you.
Why don't you try the brains? lf l had any, l wouldn't be here right now.
Mr President, the dog whisperer is here.
Thank you, Agent Obvious.
Well, that's who's out Sweet niblets.
Mr President, l don't know what's going on here, but l have to tell you Wait! Wait, wait.
Humphrey has something he wants to say.
l can't wait to hear this.
What's that, Humphrey? The reason you haven't been eating is because you miss somebody terribly? Well, why don't you just tell that person? You have, but they wouldn't answer your phone calls.
l mean, listen to you.
Hold on.
l think l know what's going on here.
-You do? -You do? Of course.
My Humphrey-mumphrey misses me.
l've been so busy, l've been ignoring you, haven't l, boy? Now hold on, Mr President.
Maybe it wasn't your fault.
Maybe Humphrey was being disobedient, stubborn and a little bratty.
Oh, yeah? Well, Humphrey says he was just trying to be a dog, and sometimes dogs need to be let off their leash.
But what if that dog runs off and gets itself into all kinds of trouble? Well, you've got to trust that you've trained it well enough to know right from wrong.
And you have.
-What's that, buddy? -He said he loves you.
And he knows that you love him, too.
l do.
l do.
And we're going to be spending a lot more time together, starting now.
Come on, buddy.
l saw a French poodle in the lobby, and she's quite the hottie.
Come on.
Come on.
-l do love you, Roxy.
-And l love you.
That's why l want to protect you.
l know, but maybe Maybe l do it a little too much sometimes? Roxy, l don't want you out of my life.
l just want you in it a smidge less.
And l know that's not the way Roxy rolls, but maybe Child, you ate dog food for me.
Maybe l can bend a little for you.
So you're not gonna come on dates with me any more? No, l'm saying you just won't see me.
-l can live with that.
-So can l.
But what l can't live with is that doggie breath.
Stanky! But you still cute.
Hey, Daddy, look who's back.
Of course l'm back.
The President and his daughter are wonderful people, but they're not family.
l was there two days, not a single hug.
Well, let me just take care of that right now.
lt's good to have you back.
l'm not done.
Two whole days, Robby Ray! Miley, why are you dressed up like Lola? Right, we had to switch back at the hotel and Oh, no.
Lilly! Now we are going to do this until we get it right.
-Now, one more time from the top.
-But -What's that, everyone? -''Encore.
Encore.
More.
More.
'' You heard them.
Now five, six, seven, eight! Everybody makes mistakes Everybody has those days -And l'm having one right now.
-At least you get to go home.

Lilly, why do you read that tabloid trash? They're nothing but lies.
-''Hannah Montana looks fabulous.
'' -With the occasional glimmer of truth.
You didn't let me finish.
''Too bad she's really a guy.
'' -You've got to be kidding.
-l can't believe you didn't tell me.
You slept over at my house.
You borrowed my bras.
Hey, l look good in the moustache.
Oh, yeah, l would definitely date me.
Me, too.
-Awkward.
-Awkward.
-Oh, oh! -Let me guess.
lt's another article about Jake Ryan, isn't it? lt says his movie is done and he's back in town for the premiere.
Big whoop! l don't need some guy who kisses me knowing he's about to leave for six months to do some stupid movie.
Jake could fall out of the sky wearing a tuxedo and l wouldn't care.
-Miley? -l'm serious.
He could come down, giving me a dozen roses, and it would make no difference.
Zero.
Zilch.
El zippo.
What if he got down on his knees and begged you to take him back? Like that's ever gonna happen.
Sorry, it's only one rose.
But l did bring chocolates.
Not just chocolates, chocolates from the sky.
Jake, l don't know what to say.
So, l guess l'll just show you how l feel.
Thank you.
come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds Thanks.
Gee, another basket from Jake.
What a surprise! l agree, Mile.
Either date this boy Jake or tell him to send a workout tape, because l'm about one muffin away from my easy-fit jeans.
l got two words for you, willpower.
l got two words for you, mini jellies.
l'm so weak.
Look who was waiting in the driveway.
You can almost hear him say, ''Miley, take me back.
Give me one more chance.
'' Oh, l'll give you something.
Not the chocolate chip ones.
Use the bran, nobody eats those.
Oh, my dad does.
He calls them ''nature's broom.
'' Peanut butter balls.
Hello, guys, this jerk hurt me and he's not gonna win me back with peanut butter balls.
Okay, you're right, darling.
l'm getting rid of everything.
And l'll start by grilling up these perfectly marbled T-bones.
-Medium rare, please.
-Got it.
Come on, Miley, the poor guy has done just about everything a girl could want.
What more could he do? Yeah, Miley, what else can l do? You're never gonna stop, are you? Miley, you've dumped stuff on me and you've yelled at me.
The one thing you haven't done is tell me that you don't care about me.
-Tell me that, and l'll go away.
-No, you can't.
He's so And you're l mean, come on.
l know l kissed you and then left, and l'm sorry.
But l never stopped thinking about you.
Oh, he never stopped, and now, l mean, come on.
-l'll just go help with the steaks.
-You do that.
Come on, Jakers.
Okay, l never stopped thinking about you, either.
-Then you'll give me another chance? -How about we start with tonight? Slight problem.
Tonight's my movie premiere.
Oh, that's okay.
l mean, it's a little more public than l wanted.
But No, no, no.
See, the thing is You already have a date, don't you? lt's not a real date, okay? lt's with my co-star, okay? We just have to pretend that we're dating for the press, you know, a kiss or two, but it doesn't mean anything.
Nothing you say ever means anything.
You're the same jerk you were six months ago, except now you're a jerk with a headache.
l don't have a -Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.
l'm so hot.
Yes, you are.
-Could l get a bottle of water? -Yes, you are.
Can.
l mean, yes, you can.
Oh, sorry, Rico just tripled his price to three bucks.
But that's all l have, and as l said before, l'm so, so hot.
Don't go anywhere.
Okay, l've taken care of me.
Now, you.
You can have the employee discount.
-You're fired.
-What are you talking about? Nice work, Natasha.
Go buy yourself something pretty.
No, no, wait.
Come back.
l'm willing to look past this and start anew.
You ripped me off.
Me? You're the one ripping people off.
Three bucks for a bottle of water? That's stealing.
That's America.
You want to give stuff away? Open your own shack.
You can call it lHOF.
lnternational House of Failure.
Oh, well, maybe l will.
But instead l'll call it lnternational House of Reasonably-Priced Water, and Fries and Stuff.
lHORPWAFAS.
Yeah, hear the name and tremble, Rico.
lHORPWAFAS.
l'm Brian Winters, and the stars are all out for the premiere of Teen Gladiators and the Sword of Fire.
And here are the Teen Gladiators, Jake Ryan and Marissa Hughes coming over to talk to me, Brian Winters.
So, Jake, l don't know what's bigger, the buzz about this movie, or the buzz about you two.
Oh, well, thanks, Brian.
We're both really excited about this movie.
-Aren't we, honey? -We sure are, Jakey.
We sure are, Jakey.
Look at her.
Draped over him like drapes.
Cheap, clingy drapes.
lt's disgusting.
Sure is.
How can you guys keep eating that stuff? That's Jake's steak, the stake he drove through my heart.
The good news is, it cuts like butter.
Dad? l'm sorry, darling, but you're better off without him.
lf he's gonna choose her over you, he obviously has no taste.
Except in meat.
This filet is fantastic.
Look at him.
All kissy with Marissy.
''lt's only pretend.
lt doesn't mean anything.
'' Yeah, right, l was on your Tv show, bub.
You're not that good an actor.
So, Jake, tell me, when did you first know you were in love? Well, l know it sounds hokey, but the minute l looked into Miley's eyes -Miley? -Oh, sorry.
l meant Marissa.
What? Did he just say Girls hate the name flub.
Trust me, been there done that.
But we all make mistakes, right, Jake? Yeah, and l'm in the middle of a big one right now.
Marissa's a good friend.
The truth is, l'm in love with a girl named Miley Stewart.
But l blew it.
That's the difference between movies and real life.
ln real life, you don't always get a happy ending.
l'm in love with a girl named Miley Stewart.
l'm in love with a girl named Miley Stewart.
l'm in love with a girl named Miley Stewart.
Mile, you're gonna break it.
l don't care.
Hey, Gladiator.
Miley? Who says real life doesn't have happy endings? This is so cool.
l'm used to Hannah being famous, but now Miley is, too.
Your life is totally gonna change.
lt is not.
Other than having the best boyfriend ever, my Miley life is gonna stay exactly the same.
Hi.
Hi.
Ashley, are you lost? You are so funny.
l've always loved that about you.
Mean girl say what? Stop it.
You are a delight.
We're gonna be such great friends.
Lilly, l love what you've done with your hair.
l'm wearing a hat.
Hi.
Hi.
What are you doing here? You said you were going to the mall.
And you said you were getting a manicure.
Yeah, l am, with my new BFF.
You mean, my new BFF.
All your beach needs at reasonable prices.
l got Mylar balloons, and day-old bran muffins.
Oh, come on, everybody.
They're ''nature's broom.
'' Hey, Jackson.
How is it going? Dude, l don't get it.
Rico rips people off, and he still gets all the business.
Well, maybe because at Rico's you get over-priced hotdogs, right? And here you get half-priced food poisoning.
l mean, seriously, Jackson, this relish stinks.
-That's mayonnaise.
-Okay.
Okay, so, maybe the shack doesn't have ''refrigeration,'' and the food isn't always ''edible,'' and maybe we do have a little bit of a ''bug problem.
'' But the shack's got character, and like me, it's here to stay.
l can fix this.
Yeah, you got nacho cheese all over my mom's homemade jerky.
How will l live with the guilt? l was supposed to take this to the precinct for the other cops, but now you've got the meat with the cheese, it's not kosher.
Oh, Detective Schwartz is gonna go all meshuggeneh.
Dude, l don't wanna tell you how to run your shack, but this only works for like really short people.
-Not now, Todd.
-Hey, what's this? Well, it was my mom's homemade jerky.
Covered in cheese? How is it? l'm the man who had the cheese l'm the man who had the jerky We put 'em both together And dude, it really worky -cheese jerky! -cheese jerky! -Say what? -Say what? -cheese jerky! -cheese jerky! -Say what? -Say what? Mozzarella moose Swiss ham and Gouda turkey! Just one taste, it'll drive you berzerky! cheese jerky! -Say what? -Say what? And it's all freaky, freaky, freaky, fresh! Sizzling Stewart with Smokin' Oken Enterprises, patent pending.
Cheese jerky? That's the dumbest thing l've ever heard.
Maybe, but it's delicious.
Just try it.
-You don't like it? -lt's delicious, and it's not mine.
Yet.
You see those sparkly stars in a line? That's Orion's Belt.
And that star just to the right of the belt, that's my new favourite.
lt's named Miley.
-Shut up.
lt is not.
-lt is now.
Here's your certificate to prove it.
You named a star after me? lt was either that or a half a mile of lnterstate 5.
Miley, l've never felt so close to anyone before, and l don't want there to be any secrets between us, so l'm gonna tell you something that l've never told anyone before.
Please don't have a hairy back.
Please don't have a hairy back.
My real name is Leslie.
Leslie, right.
That's good.
Seriously, what's the secret? That is the secret.
And l love that name.
l had a hamster named Leslie once, until l figured out it was a boy.
Go ahead.
Make fun.
No, no, l'm sorry.
l'm actually touched that you trust me so much.
l do, and l can't tell you how great it feels that l don't have to hide part of my life from you, because l know that you'd never do that to me.
Yeah.
Sure.
Of course.
Now we know everything about each other.
Yeah.
Sure.
Of course.
There are no secrets between us.
Yeah.
Sure.
Of course.
That star didn't set you back too much, did it? -Well -So Dad? Don't you think the light would be much better in the house? Oh, don't worry about me, darling.
l can see everything l need to see, right here.
All right.
l'm gonna read Family circus now, so it should take about two seconds.
Ready? One.
Two.
Good night, Jake.
Good night, sir.
Oh, honey, don't be mad at me.
l gave you two seconds.
lt's not my fault the boy's got slow lips.
lt's not that.
Daddy, tonight Jake was totally honest with me, and because of the Hannah secret, l couldn't be the same with him.
And when he asked me out for tomorrow night, l had to lie to him again, because Hannah is reading to that second grade class tomorrow.
What kind of relationship will it be if l have to lie to him about half of my life? Well, you could always tell him the truth.
What? Or not.
Honey, l know it's a tough decision, but l'm sure you'll make the right one.
No, l won't.
l'm 1 4.
l'm almost guaranteed to mess this up.
You're the adult.
You're supposed to tell me what to do.
What kind of a father would l be if l just ordered you around all the time? A normal one.
l swear, you are no help at all.
What? Even when l don't say something, l say something wrong.
Well, at least they're off the porch.
''And so all the animals on Honest lsland were saved.
''All because Trudy, the truthful turtle, ''promised she would never tell another lie.
'' Thank you, Hannah.
Class? Thank you, Hannah Montana.
Does anyone have questions about honesty for Miss Montana? Or we could read another book.
How about Frankie, the Fibbing Frog? Sweet niblets.
-Samantha.
-Hannah, have you ever lied? Good question.
Any more questions? Yes, sweetie.
Why won't you answer Samantha's question? Listen, sometimes life gets complicated, and people get put into situations that are complicated.
Miss Montana, l'm sure you're not suggesting to a class of second-graders -that lying is ever okay? -No, no, no, of course not.
lt's just that sometimes you have to.
Hannah Montana's a liar.
No, no, of course not.
Listen, listen.
lt's just that, you know, well Superman doesn't tell Lois Lane that he's Clark Kent, but it doesn't mean he doesn't love her.
-Superman's a liar? -What? No, no, no, never mind.
He isn't real.
-Superman isn't real? -What? Okay, come on.
Okay, how many of your parents have told you that you're gonna be president some day? Well, see? Think about it.
Not all of you can be president.
Odds are none of you will be president.
Well, it's just that l was l'm gonna Who wants free CDs? Free CDs, everyone.
Hey, Miley, got your call.
What's up? Jake, you were totally honest with me, and l have a secret, too.
And l'm not sure how you're gonna take it.
Oh, come on, how bad can it be? You're not married, are you? No, l'm not married, and neither is Hannah Montana.
What? l'm Hannah Montana.

l'm Hannah Montana.
Jake? Jake? Leslie? Just give me a second, okay? lf it helps, you're doing better than Oliver.
He fainted when l told him.
Jake Ryan doesn't faint.
Leslie, on the other hand, is a little woozy.
Listen lf you're gonna be mad, don't be mad at Miley.
-She wanted to tell you, but -But what? Hannah wouldn't let her? Well, you know, she's a pop star.
You know how they can be.
Total divas.
l try to avoid them.
So it's just the two of you, right? l mean, you're not also the Dixie Chicks, are you? No.
Just Miley and Hannah.
Two chicks here.
Well, if that's the case, then l think you're both pretty great.
-Really? -Really.
Oh, man, paparazzi.
-They follow me everywhere.
-They follow me everywhere.
l think they're following me, you know, a big movie about to open.
Hello! Millions of albums already sold.
-Okay, we'll just go ask them then.
-No.
You're not dating Hannah.
You're dating Miley.
You can't get caught cheating on me with me.
Keep up, movie star.
Ain't rocket science.
come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds Helicopters, movie stars, forbidden love? lt's all so romantic.
lt would be even more romantic if you would chew with your mouth closed.
So when you told him you were Hannah, he didn't faint? -Not once? -Nope.
Steady as a rock.
All man.
Well, so am l.
l just hadn't eaten that day.
You know what the best part is? Now l can finally be myself with a guy.
No more secrets.
Just a normal boy-girl relationship.
Why don't you all take a picture? lt'll last longer.
Hello, people, it's just an expression.
Miley, relax.
Just ignore them.
-Why don't l get us some drinks? -Okay.
Wow, l'm kind of thirsty.
Do you want water, fruit juice or ice-tea? Are you sure you're not mad l made us leave early? -That's okay, it gives us more time to -Who wants lemonade? say hi to your dad.
Yes, sir.
Sweet lemonade.
Refreshing and as close to puckering as anybody's gonna get around here.
Excuse me, Jake.
-Daddy, can l talk to you in private? -Sure, doll.
Listen, Dad, l don't know how to tell you this.
Go away! Okay, l can take a hint.
l'm gonna step out and let you two kids have a little chat, but just remember, the heating ducts have ears.
l swear, we'll never be alone.
-We are now.
-No, we're not.
-Right, Dad? -Right, bud.
Don't worry, Miley.
Your Dad's just being a responsible parent and l admire him for that.
Won't work, boy, but nice try.
lt's not my nosy, annoying Dad l'm worried about.
lt's your fans.
They wouldn't leave us alone all night.
Come on, fans are just a part of the territory.
l thought Hannah Montana would be used to that.
She is, but Miley isn't.
That's the reason l made up the secret, so l could go out in the world like a normal person.
And that's kind of hard to do when you're dating me.
A little bit.
Does this help? A little bit.
How about a little bit more? l'm not hearing any chatting.
Sonny, this cheese jerky is fantastic.
You have to give me the recipe.
Oh, sorry, ma'am, my mom's jerky and his dad's cheese recipe, they're top secret.
But l'm a grandmother.
You can trust me.
You know, we would, but we weren't born yesterday, and neither was this baby.
Rico! This isn't over! That cheese jerky will be mine! Oh, man, it's packed.
This is gonna be a disaster.
No, it's not, if Oliver orders the chilli dog pizza again.
We'll just sit by the window.
Actually, l'm not hungry.
l'm all cheese jerkied up.
Which brings us right back to the window.
Stop worrying about Oliver.
l'm thinking about Jake.
No matter where we go, it's like a zoo.
The beach, the movies, the mall.
Everybody just does this.
Okay, that's creepy.
Oh, and by the way, easy on the liner, looking a little trampy.
She look very nice to me.
Thanks.
Appreciate it, but l have a boyfriend.
Big coincidence, because l have American girlfriend and her name is Miley.
Weirdo, say what? Miley, it's me.
-Jake? -Jake? lt's Milos.
You like? Look, now l'm just a regular guy.
l'm a nobody, like Oliver.
Brilliant! Hey! -You did this for me? -l did this for us.
Oh, you're so sweet, but could you please be sweet without the accent? l don't like.
lf it makes you happy, sure.
Just a normal guy, with normal friends, eating normal pizza.
Excuse me, people, l'm ready to order.
-Hey! -Hey, man! Hey, buddy, who do you think you are? -Well actually, l'm -Just a normal guy.
And here in Normalville, we take a normal number and wait our normal turn.
Oh, right.
No sweat.
l did this in an episode of zombie High.
''Haunted Deli,'' take a number and wait to die.
-So, what number are we? -Thirty-two.
Number six.
-Are you kidding me? -Milos! Oh, sorry.
Got it.
Normal people wait.
l'll wait.
This is endless! You know, let's go.
Look like Milos has a little bit of temper.
How do people do this? lt's agony.
How long have we been here? Well, in one minute it'll be exactly a minute and a half.
Thanks for letting me cut in front of you, sweetie.
My boyfriend just got his tonsils out.
He can barely talk.
Honey, what's taking so long? Did l say tonsils? l meant kidney.
My mom has a TASER.
Okay, then, bye.
-There you go, just what you ordered.
-ls it all better now? Totally.
And doesn't it taste much better knowing that you had to wait for it? Not really.
You know, this ice cream is making me thirsty.
Oh, boy.
l said, this ice cream is making me Normal people get their own water.
Really? Thanks, kid.
See you at the movies.
Mommy! -Run.
-Why? Soccer mom with a TASER.
l've never felt this way before.
And l know you've only been in my life for a short time, but Heck, l'm just gonna say this.
l love you.
That's right, l love you, super-secret cheese jerky recipe.
Silly, silly boy.
Well, as long as l'm here Man, that's good.
What a rush.
All night and no one recognised me.
And l gotta admit, l wasn't really sure if l could do this whole normal thing.
l mean, l've been famous since l was the face of Wonder Diapers.
''The only diaper endorsed by astronauts.
'' Did l tell you that already? You might have mentioned it once or twice.
Or 30 times.
Anyway, it was a great night.
Except for this wig.
l mean, it's worse than the one l wore on Teen Bigfoot.
''The only thing bigger than his foot'' ''was his heart!'' -Still gets to me.
-lt's getting to all of us.
-Where can l take this wig off? -Upstairs, first door on the left.
-Okay.
Be right back.
-Can't wait.
Miley, we don't exactly know how to tell you this -Jake's horrible.
-Yeah, that's pretty much it.
l don't understand.
l mean, Hannah Montana's a star, too, but underneath Hannah is a real person.
-And underneath Jake is -More Jake? l really liked him.
How could l not see this? Miley, none of us saw it.
Come on, it's the first real time you guys have spent together.
Now that l have So, what are you gonna do? Learn to love his flaws? Right.
Like the adorable way he steals water from little girls.
-l have to break up with him, don't l? -l think so.
What if gets mad? He could tell your secret.
Guys, come on, Jake's a lot of things, but he's not evil.
l'll tell you what, next time you people give me an itchy wig, l'll spread the word and put you out of business.
People try to mess with Jake Ryan, Jake Ryan plays hardball.
So, what'd l miss? -Nothing! -Nothing! Oh, guys, come on.
Let's watch me on Tv.
Look how cute Jake is.
Why did you have to talk and ruin everything? Okay, l've been thinking about your problem and l got a couple of ideas that'll fix it.
This isn't going to be something stupid like, ''Move to Peru,'' is it? No! Please tell me you don't have ''face transplant'' on there, too.
Well, l wasn't Fine! And now, l have to go to another premiere with him and act like he's not the most obnoxious person l've ever met.
l just wish l could find a way to get him to break up with me.
l know.
He'd break up with you in a second if you were half as obnoxious as he is.
-Lilly, you're a genius.
-Oh, thank you.
Wait, was this about the Peru or the face transplant? -Peru.
-l knew it, l just Sometimes.
Oh, sorry, folks, we're all sold out.
But don't worry, come back tomorrow, there'll be plenty more.
Yep, that's right, Rico, l'm turning them away.
And look lt's raining money, yeah.
l can't watch this any more.
Wait, wait.
Look, look, look.
l'm rolling in money.
What are you doing? Laughing like Rico and rolling in money? -You should try, dude.
lt's fun.
-Oh, cool.
Oh, but first, my mom gave me the receipts for all the supplies she bought and we gotta settle up.
Please tell me the big one's for us.
You might want to look away.
Make it quick.
-Jackson -Just go.
Why, why, why? And here comes Jake Ryan with his not-famous girlfriend, Milkey.
lt's Miley.
Anyway, how does it feel to be a regular girl dating a big star? Hang on, Bri, l got a throat itch.
Oh, yeah, much better.
You were saying? Wow, Jake, this one's a keeper.
Oh, man, these lights are warm.
l'm just gonna air myself out.
l guess we know what happened to the ugly duckling.
-Maybe we should just go inside.
-Oh, that's a good idea.
But first l gotta Oh, yeah, that feels nice.
Anybody got a lawn mower? There's a breeze in Pittsburgh, if you get my drift.
-Put your arms down.
-Why? Oh, man, that's embarrassing.
l meant to braid those.
Oh, my gosh, l just forgot.
We forgot to feed the cat.
Let's go home.
We don't have a cat, you silly goose.
Maybe we can build one with your armpits.
Jake, you haven't said a word the whole ride home.
Did l do something wrong? Stop it, okay? l know exactly what you're doing.
-You do? -Yeah, of course l do.
l'm not an idiot.
Okay, fine.
Maybe l went about it the wrong way, but Little Miss Hannah Montana can't handle it when it's all about Jake Ryan.
What? Yeah, you'll do anything to steal my spotlight.
-Face it, you're jealous of me.
-Jealous of you? Why, yes, l am.
l am a jealous egomaniac and you should dump me right now.
You know what? l'll make it easier on you.
Goodbye.
l'm not gonna break up with you.
Miley, we can get through this.
You'll learn to not be jealous just like l learnt to be a normal guy.
Oh, sweet niblets.
You don't know what a normal guy is.
What are you talking about? Okay, maybe l'm not normal on the outside, but inside beats the heart of a kid just like you.
That's from Teen Bigfoot.
-So? -So? That's exactly what l'm talking about.
Normal people don't say things that other people wrote for them.
Normal people don't steal water from little girls.
Excuse me if l didn't know that.
Okay, the only reason l did this stupid normal thing was for you.
You know what? l'm out of here.
Being normal's not stupid.
lt lets me have real friends and it reminds me that l'm just like everybody else.
And you like that? l love that, and l thought you did, too.
Remember when we met? You said that sometimes you wish you had a normal life.
Where's that guy? That's the guy l want for my boyfriend.
Not this.
So, how was the movie? Good night, Nurse Nickel.
What are you wearing? Daddy, not now.
Ain't seen that many feathers since your Uncle Earl and Aunt Pearl had their annual pillow fight.
Well, if you didn't want to go out with me any more, why didn't you just tell me, instead of going all woolly mammoth at the premiere? Because l was afraid that if l dumped you you'd get so upset and you'd What? Tell your secret? Well, if that's the kind of guy you think l am, then maybe l will tell your secret.
Here you go, doll.
Fudge ripple's like a heartbreak airbag.
Doesn't stop the hurting but it sure cushions the blow.
l don't get it.
l lie to my boyfriend and feel horrible.
l tell him the truth and it blows up in my face.
Maybe l should just give up guys for good.
Oh, honey, not for good.
Just until l'm dead.
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.
lt wasn't the truth or the lies that caused all this.
lt was the boy.
He just wasn't the right one.
l guess you're right.
But you know what's weird? Now that Jake's gonna blow my secret, l don't know which one l'm gonna miss more, my normal life or the guy l thought Jake was.
Well, honey, no matter what happens, we're gonna make it through this.
We always do.
At least l know one big, handsome guy who will always love me.
Who that? Oh, me.
-Hello? -Back here.
-Delivery for Miley Stewart.
-Really? Thanks.
Now, who would be sending you flowers? Dear Miley, l thought about what you said and you're right.
l do wish l was a normal person sometimes.
l just don't know how to do that yet.
But when l figure it out, l hope l'll be worthy of someone as terrific as you.
And don't worry, your secret will always be safe with me.
''Love, Leslie.
'' Who in the Sam Heck is Leslie? A friend.
A very good friend.
Well, let's hope it's not another actor.
What are you doing here? What are you talking about? l work here.
-But l fired you.
-No, you didn't.
Sure l did, and then you opened that shack.
What shack? But But it was right over And you And And Oliver And cheese jerky And l was in a baby stroller lt's gonna be okay.
Let me take you home.
But you rolled in money.
Sure l did.

cooking up some eggs Frying them up in a pan Gonna add a little cheddar 'cause l'm a cheesy omelette man -Good morning, Cheesy Omelette Man.
-Good morning, Cheesy Omelette Man.
Good morning, my loving, beautiful family.
Eggs, bacon.
Either there was a Dukes of Hazzard marathon on last night or you just wrote a new Hannah song! Honey, you know me better than that.
lf l'd have wrote a new song, there'd be cinnamon toast.
-New song! -Cinnamon toast! There's nothing like finally cracking a new song, and this one was a bear.
l can't wait to hear it! Let me go get Lucky Lulu.
Where's Lucky Lulu? Lulu's like a lot of older California women.
She's having some work done on her neck.
That's okay.
We can just use Whammy-bar Wally.
He's wonesome.
Now, honey, you know l never play you a new song without Lulu.
Especially one that could be your biggest hit ever.
Biggest hit ever? Okay, you at least got to tell me what it's about.
Breaking up? Making up? Please don't let it be another song about my double life.
l mean, you might as well tattoo ''l'm really Miley Stewart'' on my forehead.
Sorry, honey, you'll just have to wait.
Lulu won't be back until Monday, and l won't be back until after l jog 5 miles.
Matter of fact, make that 5 and a half.
All right, Daddy, whatever you say.
l'll wait because you want me to.
l love you! All right, where'd that bacon-eating hillbilly hide my song? Did you see how happy he was? This is great! Now he'll finally let me have another party at the house.
Are you joking? Remember the last time you had a party? Hey, it was one itty-bitty, little city-wide power outage.
They had to land a jumbo jet on the freeway.
And now those passengers have a great story to tell.
Gotcha! Look, l've been begging for months and all l've heard was, ''Can't talk.
Got to finish the song.
Can't talk.
Got to finish the song.
''Fudgy Buddy.
'' Well, he's finished the song, he's in a great mood, which means Max, the party animal is back! Saturday night, my house! This is awful.
So, are we smelling a hit? l'm smelling something, but l ain't sure it's a hit.
This song stinks.
-Oh, no.
-Yes.
Take a whiff.
come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds ''Dang flabbit, where's that rabbit? ''He's got a habit of running away ''Hey, honey, where's that bunny? He took my money, that ain't okay ''Hey, hey, hey, bunnay'' Well, it certainly rhymes.
-With a good band -Good band.
-Some backup vocals -Backup vocals.
lt'll still be a song about bunnies! Which could become an Easter classic.
Classic.
This is horrible.
l've never hated one of his songs before.
-How am l gonna tell him? -Maybe you won't have to.
l mean, maybe he'll think about it, realise that it's horrible, and then fix it before he shows it to you.
-Hey, everybody! -Hey, Daddy! -Hi! -What up? -Look at those abs.
-Sir.
So, Daddy, how was your jog? lt was great! But l keep thinking about that new song.
Really? -What song? -You wrote a song? Who knew? lnteresting.
Easter.
lsland.
Easter lsland.
We're studying it at school.
Big statues.
Nobody knows how they got there.
Weird.
Yeah, really weird! So, so strange.
Strange.
l would ask what's going on, but then you'd tell me, and why would l want that? So, Daddy, you were thinking about the song? Nothing wrong with that, just keep on thinking! Please.
Yeah, well, you know how sometimes you write something and then you take another look at it later and it's not as good as you thought? -Yeah? -Well, this ain't one of those times! lt isn't? Are you sure? l'm real sure.
l mean, this song is great, and l can't wait to see the look on your face when l play it for you on Monday.
-What are you gonna do? -Stick my head in the freezer.
Please defrost me when you find a cure for this song.
l will tell you what she's gonna do, all right? She's gonna tell him that she loves it.
Why? Because she's a wonderful daughter who doesn't want to break her father's heart.
This is still about your party, right? Look, Max has already invited 50 people and reserved a deli platter in my name! Please tell me there's no raisins in the coleslaw.
Dude, you are not invited! l can't believe l'm saying this, but Jackson's right.
He's worked so hard on this song, and he's so proud of it.
l've got to tell him l love it.
You know what, Miley? lt'll be okay.
So Hannah sings one clunker, big deal.
Yeah, and the video will be cute.
You surrounded by giant, dancing bunnies, right? l'm the bunny who stole your money -l'm not helping, am l? -No.
Miles, if it makes you feel any better, l know this is kind of hard on you, but, my life, it's so good right now! Boo-yah! Yeah! And you are still not invited! Got to tell Dad.
Got to tell Dad.
Dad? Got to tell Dad.
lt's true! There's no place like home! There's no place like home! -Stop it, Jackson.
Be a man.
-Dad? Dad? Look at that body slam! -Where's Dad? -He's still on his date.
Have to tell him the truth.
-What? -Have to tell him the truth.
No.
Wait, what are you Miles, what are you doing? Hate that song.
Hate that song.
Oh, man.
Are you sleepwalking? l'll take that as a yes.
Sorry.
Come on, Miles.
Miley, wake up.
Come on, Miley, wakey, wakey! Oh, no, Dad.
Dad? Hate that song.
Got to tell Dad! No, no.
Of course you do.
l'll take you to him.
He's right under here! No way you're blowing my party! Jackson, what in the world? Miley sleeping, Jackson helping, thigh cramping.
And they wonder why l never bring my dates home.
Got to tell Dad.
Got to tell Dad.
Got to tell Jackson, what are you doing? First of all, do you want to tell Dad the truth? No! Of course not! Good.
You're awake.
And you're ugly.
Now that we've covered the obvious, what are you doing here? You were sleepwalking, and you almost told Dad that you hate his song.
Yeah, right.
You think some guy named Jimmy in your Biology class is ''yum-alicious.
'' -How do you know that? -You told me that an hour ago! Look, this is just like that time you were five, and you lied about breaking Mom's favourite vase.
Remember? You felt so guilty, you started sleepwalking and blabbing the truth about everything.
Remember? Oh, no.
Uncle Earl never forgave me for telling his poker buddies he hides aces in the folds of his belly.
-You are not going to blow my party.
-Hey, l'm doing the best l can! Now you're going to do the best that l can.
Got to tell Dad.
Got to tell Dad.
One, two, cha, cha, cha.
l pulled the mullet, Mother, but it just wouldn't come off.
Miley, you haven't slept in two days.
You can't keep doing this.
You've got to get some rest.
l know, but if l fall asleep at home, l'm not going to be able to stop myself from telling Daddy the truth.
And if l fall asleep anywhere else, who knows what's going to spill out of my mouth! Speaking of something spilling out of your mouth, somebody forgot to brush this morning.
Hey, what do you want from me? l'm amazed l could even get myself dressed.
Love the new look, toots.
Sweet niblets.
Wow, she is tired.
Yeah, l know.
Hey, she can sleep over at my house tonight.
Hey, Miley, you can Miley? -Good morning, class.
-Kunkle! Comma Miss.
Oken comma Oliver.
Truscott comma Lilly.
-Don't drag me into this.
-Okay.
Oken, someday, years from now, you may feel the urge to come back and visit me.
Please don't.
Miley.
Miley, wake up.
Wake up! Who's talking? You are, Skunkle.
ln that awful prison-warden voice of yours.
lt is torture.
Yikes.
Excuse me.
What did you say? She said your voice sounds like a prison warden, and it's torture.
-l heard her.
-Just trying to help.
l don't need your help.
What you need is to stop borrowing your grandmother's clothes.
Hey-o! Wait! No, no.
She doesn't mean it.
She's sleepwalking.
And when she sleepwalks, she can only tell the truth.
Truth! Got to tell Dad the truth! l mean, look at her.
She'd never talk to you like that if she was awake.
She'd lie and say you look nice.
Hey, great top.
Last time she wore it, you said that if you polished a table with it, the table would punch you in the face.
l was kidding.
Tables can't punch.
Wake up! -Stewart, are you really asleep? -Are you really wearing those shoes? Hey-o.
They're comfortable, and l walk to work! Why? Broom in the shop? l'm laughing, 'cause it's so ridiculous.
You're a lovely woman, and l'm surprised you haven't been married yet.
Yesterday, you said it was because of her man hands.
Soft, supple man hands is what l meant.
Would you marry me, Karen? All right, knock it off.
You're not all asleep.
That's 'cause you haven't started teaching yet.
Okay, that's enough.
Miley, wake up.
Sorry.
Where were we? Well, we're in Science, and you're in trouble.
Principal's office.
Now.
How bad was it? Well, it started with ''Skunkle'' And made it all the way down to ''man hands.
'' Thank you very much.
l'm thinking it's time to tell my daddy the truth.
-You think? -You think? Yo, Jackson.
l'm bringing a few extra people to your party.
Sorry, dude, there's no Wayne! Hey.
Yeah, dude, of course.
Bring whoever you want.
By the way, love the T-shirt.
''lf you can read this, you're about to be hit.
'' -You're a funny little dude.
-Thanks, man.
But if your party stinks, l'm gonna rearrange your face.
As well you should.
Don't read the shirt, don't read the shirt, don't read the shirt.
Dude, l cannot believe the buzz on this party! Girls are saying hi to me just because l know you! How did you get your dad to say yes to this? Well, as you know, it's just a little matter of psychology, timing and And you haven't asked him yet, have you? Okay, technically, no, but l'm on my way to ask him right now, and, trust me, he's gonna be in a great mood.
He better be.
You cancel this party, you're going to spend the rest of high school eating lunch with the chess club! You know how many hot girls are in chess club? Zero.
Well, l thought your girlfriend was in the chess club.
That's why l need this party! Hi, honey.
Really, really badly.
Dad? Dad? Just out of the shower! Down in a few! You take your time, you brilliant songwriter! You hero and role model! Whatever you broke, fix it or bury it in the yard.
Yes! Yes! He's got Lucky Lulu back, he's blow drying.
lt's a perfect storm of Dad happiness! Dad.
Dad, l got to talk to you.
Oh, no, here we go again! Miley, stop! Jackson, l'm sorry about your party, but l can't do this any more.
l've got to tell Daddy the truth.
No! No, no, no, you don't! You're just sleepwalking! Come on, Miles, upsy-daisy! Stop that! Stop it.
l'm awake! -Of course you are.
Now come here.
-Jackson Look, l know you're supposed to wake a sleepwalker gently, but you leave me no choice.
Desperate times call for loud cookware.
l'm still awake, and you're still an idiot.
What the Sam heck is going on down there? -Daddy, l -Nothing! Nothing, nothing! We're just cooking you dinner, handsome! Keep working on the 'do, we'll see you in a few! Please, please, please, wake up! l'm still awake, you're still an idiot, and now my ear is full of spit.
Sorry.
Let me rinse it for you.
Do you believe l'm awake now? Yes, l do.
Listen, Jackson.
Awake or asleep, l'm still telling Dad the truth.
No, you can't! Look, my reputation and the current arrangement of my face depends on it.
Maybe next time your face shouldn't throw a party without getting permission first! Listen, Jackson, l'm sorry, but l respect Dad too much to lie to him.
-Miley -No! Jackson, this song is a joke.
lt's embarrassing, and no matter how much it hurts, l gotta tell him that l found it and it's the worst song he's ever written.
-Miley! -lt may be the worst song ever written.
l did say ''may be.
'' l heard it.
l just can't believe it.
Dad, do you hate me? No, of course l don't hate you.
l hate it that you hate the song, but l was just so sure you'd love it.
You were? l mean, you were? l don't get it.
You've never hated one of my songs before.
l suppose l could take another look at it.
What was it that bothered you? The music? The lyrics? The message? What message? ''Dang flabbit, where's my rabbit? He took my money'' What are you trying to say, bunnies can't be trusted? Dad, this isn't funny.
Come on, kids don't want to hear that stuff.
-They love bunnies! -Yeah.
And so did you when you were five years old.
That's when you wrote that song.
Bunny man say what? Well, actually, you came up with the words, but l wrote it down for you.
But you signed it with that little booger right there.
What was it doing in your pocket? l keep it with me for when l get stuck.
Give me a little bit of inspiration and a giggle every now and then.
Kind of reminds me of the good old days.
You would have known that if you'd have just asked.
Man.
Wait a minute.
You mean there's a good song? There sure is.
This is it.
You want to hear it? Do bunnies steal money? -l am loving it already! -You ain't even heard it, Son.
Sure, l have.
ln here.
Please be good, please be good, please be good.
-All right, here it goes.
-All right.
l see your face l see your eyes What you feel is no surprise Everyone needs something to believe in And l believe l smell a Grammy! Tell me your dreams, l'll tell you mine ln our hearts, we'll look inside And see the colours of a rainbow And l know We all want to believe in love We all want to believe in something Bigger than just us We all want to be a part Of a greater picture lt's hanging in our hearts Yeah, it's bigger than us lt fills the universe lt lights the skies above lt rescues all our hearts with love With love -Thanks, Daddy.
-My pleasure, bud.
That's what's bigger than us lt's love, it's love that's bigger than us lt's love, it's love that's bigger than us lt's love, it's love -That was great, dude.
-Well, thanks for coming! Glad you guys had a good time.
Especially you, Wayne! Watch out for that branch! Or just ignore it and walk right through it.
Who needs a helmet, huh? ln the light it looks a lot worse.
Well, that's okay, Son.
l'll just call the maid service.
Well, thanks, Dad! You know, that is one of the many reasons why you're still my hero, my role model, my Just a second.
-Hello? -Clean it up.
Who is this? l think you've got the wrong number.
Don't call here any more.

l'm gonna put on my old blue jeans Gonna walk out of here into the street Would you put up resistance? Would it make a difference? Would you know the real me? Me in my old blue jeans Hannah, you rock! l can't believe you did three encores! l can't believe you did three encores.
You know we have a science project due Monday.
What is wrong with you? Okay.
Let's leave this boring rock star life behind and get back to the glamorous world of earthworm larvae.
You decent, girl? l got your squeaky little friend out here.
l told you, it's a nasal condition.
And, Hannah, l brought someone who wants to meet you.
No way.
We're already late, and l promised our larvae we'd be home by 1 0:00.
Okay, fine, l'll get rid of whoever it is Hey, l'm Jesse.
Oh, my gosh.
lt's Jesse McCartney.

How about Tuesday -Yearbook committee.
-of next week? -Homecoming float.
Which l just realised is no good, either.
Busy, busy bee.

Thanks.
This stinks.
Of course they stink.
They live in their own poop.
Not the worms.
My life.
l cannot believe l gave up Jesse McCartney for a slimy piece of fish bait.
She didn't really mean that, Ernie.
She loves you.
lf only l could've told Jesse the truth.
He would've understood about school stuff, but then l'd blow the secret.
This double life is so hard.
Look, a shooting star.
l wish for an A on the project.
What do you wish for? Man, l wish l wish there was no secret, l was just Hannah Montana all the time.
Sure would make life a whole lot easier.

l'm only taking the shape of Roxy to make you more comfortable, and l'm loving it.
Okay.
How about you just wait here while l go get some very nice men with a very big net? You don't believe me? Well, if l wasn't an angel, could l do this? Check out my fly kicks, and l do mean fly kicks.
No, no, no, no, no.
This cannot be happening.
lt's already happened.
You wished upon a star, and now Hannah Montana is who you are.
-Wow.
-Nice crib, huh? Look at this place! lt is so rock-star.
l mean, the twinkly lights, the leather couches, and look at that awesome chandelier.
-Madonna has one just like it.
-Not any more.

Your favourite breakfast cake, mademoiselle Montana.
-Triple Dutch chocolate? -With a fudge ripple middle.
l really love this.
l will put it next to the hot tub so that you can chill out while you pig out.
l speak French.
You have a whole different life.
You lived in France, you own polo ponies, and you have a black belt in jujitsu, which came in handy when you fought that tiger on circus with the Stars.
l fought a tiger? l am so cool.
Good morning, Hannah.
Mr Corelli.
What are you doing here? Home school teacher.
Hannah can't go to public school.
Yeah, l dropped by early to grab a little chow.
You know how much l love Pierre's omelette du fromage.
By the way, that's French for ''cheese omelette.
'' l know! Hey, Hannah, do you have that history report for me? History report.
Right, well Hey, no excuses, young lady.
lf you do not have that report Who cares? lt's home schooling á la Corelli.
By the way, loving the Team Montana jacket.
Bling, bling, bling.
Wore it to the salon yesterday, got a free back wax.
So, l don't have to worry about my assignments? You don't have to worry about anything.
You are Hannah Montana.
And l am loving it.
Yeah, life is pretty sweet when you don't have to deal with all that Miley stuff.
You got that right.
No math test, no stinky earthworms and And more time to spend with your man.
-l got a man? -Not just a man, but the man.
Santa Lucia Oh, mamma mia The perfect night with the perfect girl.
Santa Lucia l'd sing to you myself, but l need these lips for something else.
You're so cute when you say ''Eep.
'' Sorry, sugar lips, but my wings are getting all soggy.
You couldn't have given me one more minute? Sorry, but the top of the gondola? Romantic.
Bottom? Nasty.
l can't believe it.
All these years, l was so paranoid about my secret getting out, but, boy, was l wrong! This life is perfect.
Hannah-kins! How's my favourite little rock star? -Great.
How's my favourite little -Stepmom.
Step What? Candice was your first home school teacher.
Now she's my mom? That must've been some parent-teacher conference.
Hey, hey, hey, darling.
You missed some gnarly boarding.
-Gnarly boarding? -Totally.
Next time we go to Switzerland, you so gotta come with us.
-lt was off the hook.
-Radical.
But l'm back now, baby.
Give me a big hug.
Have you been working out? l so gotta stay in shape to keep up with this little kitten.
Stop it! l got some yackety-yak coming back.
How about you? Little bit.
But you know what? My dad's happy, and that's all that matters, right? That's the spirit.
Don't let a little bump in the road get you down.
Speaking of little bumps, where's Jackson? He doesn't live here any more.
Sometimes this teleporting stuff ain't easy.
Oh, no, l dinged a wing.
l got you! Jackson? Yee, doggies, a quarter! l'm eating good tonight.
-What happened to him? -Hannah Montana.
He got tired of people pretending to be his friends just to get to you, so he dropped out and became a hermit.
A stinky hermit.
Hey, what are you looking at? Get! Get! What happened to his voice? Nothing.
He just does that to scare people away.
Jackson.
Sweet nuggets! l hit the mother lode! lt's just the load.
Jackson, was being my brother really that bad? Yep! Now, get! l got my own life now.
And me and my dolphin brothers and sisters don't care about no Hanny Montanny.
Except for Dave.
He loves you.
Forget it, Dave! You want an autograph, you come up here and you ask her yourself! Wow.
When he dropped out, he must've landed on his head.
Yo yo yo lf you want to be a-viewing on what a pop star's doing Just slide me a five and watch the Hannah house live l cannot believe Oliver's selling peeks into my house.
lt's like he's turned into a A stretched-out version of that? -How we doing today, Twice My Size? -Making bacon, Mini Me.
And we ain't faking.
Time to do -a little shaking.
-A little shaking.
All of this happened because Because l was never Miley, l never went to regular school, and so l never met Oliver.
l got it.
Oh, no.
Angel, what happened to Lilly? Okay, everyone.
-Prepare to be jealous.
-Because we look -Fabulous! -Fabulous! No! You've done it now.
-lt's Hannah Montana! -Angel, help! Freeze! Okay, you know what? l don't want this life any more.
l want to be Miley again.
l want my friends back.
Too late for that.
Nobody ever gets a second wish.
Angel say what? This is your life, Hannah.
Angel, there's got to be a way to get my old life back.
l told you, superstar.
Only one wish per customer.
No refunds or exchanges.
Hey, babe.
You ready for our picnic on Papui? What in the world is Papui? The island l bought you.
Oh, my gosh.
Jesse McCartney bought me an island.
-l'm sorry, Jesse.
l can't.
-Why not? l'm sort of dealing with something right now, so You're so cute when you're dealing with something right now.
That's sweet, Jesse, but l think l need to be alone.
You're so cute when you need to be alone.
-Jesse.
-You're so cute when you say ''Jesse.
'' Get out.
You're so cute when you're kicking me out.
l'm serious.
Still so cute.
Angel, there has got to be some kind of loophole.
Well, you could No.
Well, how about if you How about Girl, l got nothing.
Angel, l want my family back, l want my friends back, and Miley Stewart does not take ''no'' for an answer.
That's because Miley Stewart doesn't exist.
Not yet, but you'd be surprised what this girl can do with a wig.
Get your genuine Hannah Montana trash We stole it ourselves and we'll sell it for cash l got toenail clippings and that's no hype clone your own Hannah while the DNA is ripe l said what, l said what, l said what l said Word -Respect.
-Respect.
l mean, where'd she find that outfit? Like, Ugly-R-Us? More like Ugly-R-Her.
-We are so funny.
-And pretty.
l love us.
-Time to hydrate.
-Time to hydrate.
-Hi.
-Yeah, whatever.
Three bottled waters with lime, pronto.
Anyway, l'm Miley, and l'm new here, and l was just wondering, do you want to be friends? Okay, first, ''Miley,'' stupid name.
B, l've already got friends.
And, cuatro, why don't you go back to the trailer park, unhitch and drive away? No, no, no.
l can't drive, but l do skateboard.
Do you skateboard? As if! lt's stupid, it's sweaty, and, hello, who wants helmet hair? You do.
You used to love helmet hair and scabby knees and elbow pad rash.
-Doesn't that sound like fun? -l took a pretty girl's karate class.
What happened to you? You're not like this.
How can you be friends with Amber and Ashley? Come on, Lilly.
You're better than that.
Okay, how do you know my name? Wait, everybody knows my name because l'm popular.
Well, does everybody know that you have a birthmark shaped like a poodle on your butt? -How do you know that? -Because l'm your best friend.
And l know somewhere deep down inside of you, our friendship is still there.
Come on, look at me.
Really, really look at me.
Come on, Lilly.
Don't you know me? Oh, my gosh.
Yes! l knew you'd be able to see the real me.
Of course l can.
The blond hair's coming out of the wig.
You're Hannah Montana! Look, everybody! Hannah Montana's back, and she knows what's on my butt! l can't believe l just said that out loud! Over here, Hannah.
Smile.
Come on, baby.
Give me a little something something.
You can't believe what he bought me.
Marrying that dumb hillbilly was the smartest thing l ever did.
Hey, darling, you okay? You been up here for hours.
No.
Oh, boy, back ways round.
This may be more than my loco hot cocoa can cure.
You still make crazy loco hot cocoa? Of course l do.
Why would you even ask a silly question like that? Because everything's wrong.
Lilly and Oliver aren't my friends any more.
-Who? -See? -And Jackson moved out.
-No, no, no.
Now, that was his choice.
Yeah, but it wouldn't have been his choice if l wouldn't have made that stupid wish and changed everything.
What wish? Bud, you're starting to sound more loco than the cocoa.
Don't you ''bud'' me.
You're the one that married a blood-sucking leech that doesn't even love you.
So that's what this is all about.
You know your stepmama warned me you might end up resenting her a little bit.
She is so smart about teenage girls.
That's 'cause last year she was one.
Now, you hold on there, young lady.
l understand you being upset, but one thing that will never change is you, me and our loco hot cocoa.
There you are.
Hey, l was wondering Snap, is that hot chocolate? Get it out! Get it out! l'm horribly allergic.
l get massive, massive headaches.
And you know what l am like when l get my headaches.
Totally.
Adiós, loco cocoa.
Daddy, what about our special drink? Just drink some tea.
What's the big diff, whiny little baby? Robby! Candy needs a shopping spree to make her head feel better! You get the best of one world Shut it.
chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of one world Miley, why did you ever make that stupid wish? l hate my life.
l ain't so crazy about it, either.
Jackson, you came back.
Well, you're darn tooting.
l may be a grumpy hermit, but l still need my reality Tv.
Now, quiet! Chauntel's about ready to eat a bug.
Jackson, Jackson.
lt's just us.
You don't have to do the voice.
What voice? Right, sometimes l forget.
Jackson, you know what? l don't even care about the voice.
l'm just so happy you came back.
Welcome home.
Didn't you hear me? l'm not staying.
But, Jackson, you have to.
l want at least some of my old life back.
l mean, you and l weren't perfect.
We fought, but we loved each other, and Dad loved us, and there was no evil stepmom, and l had great friends, and it was all because the world didn't know l was Hannah Montana.
A world that didn't know you were Hannah Montana? Boy, l'd wish for that any day.
Angel! Angel, a shooting star! Right when he wished.
Come on, that's got to count for something.
Please? Oh, man.
l'm stuck like this forever.
Congratulations.
What? She found a loophole! You have yourself a wonderful life, Miley.
Look, a shooting star.
l wish for an A on the project.
What do you wish for? l don't wish for anything.
l love my life exactly the way it is.
Fresh.
Yo, we're walking down the beach 'cause we're mega, mega stars We got girlies to spare we got tricked out cars We're the Malibu crew and we got each other's back l'm Ollie, that's Rico Now take it, J-Mac We got serious bling-bling and baggy-waggy pants So listen to us sing And watch the little guy dance Go Rico, go Rico Go Rico, go Rico Peace out.

lf cupid had a heart He would surely throw An arrow through your soul Better aim and go lf cupid had a heart You'd be mine, l know l need you to see l need you with me That was Mikayla with lf cupid Had a Heart, her first Top 1 0 hit.
All you need now is another dozen to match the record of Hannah Montana.
What do you think, Hannah, she got the right stuff? Totally, Colin, l think she's great.
Thanks, Hannah, that means a lot coming from you.
l'm welling up at the love and respect l feel between these two princesses of pop.
Well, l think there's enough room in the music world for both of us, -right, Mikayla? -Absotively, posilutely.
Adorable.
You're not gonna want to miss these two sharing the stage next week at the United People's Relief charity concert in Florida.
We'll be right back.
l'm Colin Lassiter and this is The Real Deal.
And we're out.
Speaking of relief, l've got the bladder of a kitten.
lt is so great to finally meet you, l really am a huge fan.
Yeah, l hate you.
Thanks, l feel the exact same What? Your voice is stenchy, your music is stupid, your outfits make me wanna puke on them, but it looks like somebody already did.
Okay.
l don't know what your problem is but My problem is, is l'm 1 0 times better than you and you're gonna find that out in Florida.
Miss Hannah, l'm taking all your fannas.
Okay, listen here, you one-hit bobblehead, the only thing you're taking from me is lessons.
Okay, lesson number one, this is how you do the head thing.
Yeah, that's right, l went there.
Well, you know where l'm gonna go? Down the toilet with the rest of your career? Yeah, that's right, l went there again and this time l bought property.
Back up, kid.
And don't go shooting off your little tweeny-bopper mouth at my client, okay? She started it.
Yeah, and l am ending it, little Miss Soon to Be Used to Be.
Whoa, Nelly.
l wonder who put the burr underneath your saddle, but no one talks to my client that way.
lt's okay, Dad, l can handle it.
You heard her, Zeke.
Why don't you go wait out in the wagon, okay? Excuse me? And while you're at it, you might want to shave the ferret off your face, okay? l shave mine when you shave yours.
That's right, l went there.
We are back in five, four, three Great story, Hannah.
Hey, we're back and we're having some fun now, aren't we, girls? Oh, yeah, l just can't wait till Florida.
Neither can l.
come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds l cannot wait to get to that concert to show that two-faced tone-deaf toad who's boss.
Yeah, but you have to wear something amazing.
Mikayla always looks incredible.
For a two-faced tone-deaf toad.
Well, l don't care what Mikayla wants.
lt's a benefit concert and all the girls are sharing one dressing room.
Go, Daddy.
Go, Daddy.
l don't think so, because unlike you and your ''kinfolk,'' my client didn't grow up in a barn and we're expecting our own dressing room.
Oh, l can see why you would need more room.
l mean, where else are you gonna put Mikayla's ego and your big mouth? Step off, Goober.
Oh, darn.
l'm afraid l'm losing you.
We're breaking up.
l know that trick, you're crunching potato chips.
They're corn chips and you're not getting another room.
And that's the way Robby Ray rolls.
Well, could Robby Ray roll out some cash? Hannah needs a new outfit for Florida.
l thought you were gonna wear that snazzy silver dress.
Dad, please, get with the times, that's so yesterday.
That's because yesterday's the day you bought it.
What about the one you bought at the place next to the place that we went that one time? -No, that's too -Yeah, you're right.
Plus, when you wear that you have to wear l know, and l hate those.
Who doesn't? What about the one that l bought after the one that l bought at the place next to the place? Oh, you mean the one that goes with the shoes with the things.
-l love that one.
-Me, too.
Daddy, do you even know what we're talking about? No, but as long as it doesn't cost me a wad of cash, l'm all for it.
-Your dad is so -l know! Push.
Push.
Push! Son, are you working out on that contraption or giving birth to it? Laugh all you want, old man.
But when the guns come in, there's gonna be a new sheriff in town.
And a new deputy.
You know, when l was a kid, we didn't have money for stuff like this.
You know what we lifted? Cows.
And when it rained, we went inside and lifted your Aunt Pearl.
Try lifting her up after a bowl of her homemade pinto bean soup.
Talk about your bang, pow! Are you saying that this isn't a workout? l'm not saying that at all.
Thinking it, but not saying it.
All right, well, l'd like to see you give it a try, Flabio.
Okay.
Don't come crying to me when l break your little rubber band toy.
You know l'm just kidding you, right? Well, it's not set for your height and weight.
Fine.
Then set it for my height and weight.
Matter of fact, crank it up to ''Aunt Pearl.
'' l'd like to see the rubber band toy that can handle Robby Ray.
Oh, gosh.
Hey, Dad, look, this is the dress l'm gonna wear.
What happened? Mr Puniverse got a butt-whooping from a little itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny little rubber band.
Well, l'm gonna get to feeling better soon and when l do, l'm coming after you.
Oh, no.
l better run.
You look terrible.
Are you gonna be able to make it to Florida? Lilly, he is obviously in pain.
We've gotta show a little concern.
Daddy, can l get you an ice pack, a pillow? Are you gonna be able to make it to Florida? Don't worry about me, honey.
l'm gonna be fine.
l doubt it.
When my dad's back goes out, he can't move for days.
He just sleeps on the dining room table.
Last Thanksgiving, we had to eat around him.
He had a muscle spasm.
Giblets everywhere.
Roxy, this treatment better work, otherwise l can kiss Florida goodbye.
Oh, no problem, girl.
There's never been a jacked-up back that Roxy couldn't crack.
You know, l'm feeling better already.
l think this treatment's starting to do the trick.
Oh, that's not the treatment, this is.
-l think the machine broke.
-That wasn't the machine! l'm gonna be sick.
Daddy, l am so sorry, l was just trying to help.
lt's okay, Mile.
l know you had your heart set on putting that Mikayla in her place, but there's no way l'm gonna be able to sit on a plane for five hours.
l guess you're right.
Unless we strap you to a surfboard and check you through baggage.
Why don't you just take him in a coffin? At least they're padded.
That's a great idea.
We could get him a little portable DvD player, time will just fly by.
Perfect.
Ain't gonna happen.
Let's face it.
You tried, Roxy tried.
Roxy, that's a great idea, Daddy, Roxy could take me.
No, no.
No way, honey.
Why not? Roxy's taken me to plenty of concerts before.
Not all the way across the country.
Besides, let's face it.
lf l'm not there with you, that Mikayla's manager's gonna steamroll right over you.
Oh, come on, Dad, l can handle Mikayla and her manager.
And l'll have Roxy.
Remember? ''Roxy like a puma.
'' Honey, we can't.
You're still just a kid.
But l'm your kid.
And you taught me how to stand up and fight for myself.
And l'll have Roxy.
Face it, Dad, it's all falling into place.
Not for me, it isn't.
Why not? You know l can do this.
You can trust me.
-But that's not the point.
-Then what is the point? The point is you're not ready to do this on your own.
Yes, l am, Daddy, and you know it.
Come on, Dad, let me go.
Please.
That's it, Mile, l don't want to talk about this any more.
That's not fair! l don't have to be fair.
l'm the dad and l'm not letting you go.
Why are you treating me like such a baby? Because you're acting like one.
-But, Dad! -No, Miley, not another word.
Fine.
How about three? l hate you.
Miley.
Miley Ray! Does this mean l'm your favourite kid now? l'll take that as a yes.
l have never said anything like that to my dad before, but he was just He wasn't making any sense and l got so mad! l hate him for making me say l hate him.
This is terrible.
Now Mikayla's gonna have that stage all to herself.
Lilly, l'm upset enough.
The last thing l wanna think about is Mikayla coming at you with her new hit single lf Cupid Had a Heart.
Rico, could you turn that down? -l'm sorry, is it bothering you? -Yeah.
Well, then this'll drive you crazy.
lf cupid had a heart He would make you fall You'd fall in love with me And you'd turn me on lf cupid had a heart he would Speak of the she-devil.
What is it, Mikayla? Hannah, l heard you pulled out of the concert.
What happened? Did the big pop star get scared? Listen, Micockroach.
One of my family members has a serious medical condition, okay? Yeah, it's you.
And it's called wimpotitis.
-That means you're a wimp.
-l know what it means.
Oh, l can see the headlines now.
''Mikayla rocks while heartless Hannah hides from the homeless.
'' The concert's for hunger relief.
Like l care.
Either way, l'm gonna steal all your fans and there's nothing you can do about it.
Oh, yeah, there is.
l'm gonna be there.
You are? -You are? -Yes.
And you better wear something absorbant 'cause l'm gonna be wiping the stage with you.
That's right, l went there.
You can't go to Florida without your dad.
Watch me.
Wow.
By the time you read this, Roxy and l will be on our way to Florida.
And when l come back, l'll take whatever punishment you decide to give me like the grown-up l'm trying to convince you l am.
PS: Don't blame Roxy, she doesn't know.
Dang flabbit, Jackson, get down here and help me get out of this thing.
Come on, Dad.
Not another sponge bath.
Haven't l done enough? -Not until you get me to the airport.
-Okay.
-Maybe we should change first.
-Good idea.
Sorry for the delay, folks.
We'll be leaving the gate momentarily.
Thank you for your patience.
Warm cashews, cold shrimp, and complimentary slippers? Time to let the dogs out.
Great.
l'm glad you're enjoying the flight.
lt'll be a whole lot better once we take off.
Come on, flyboy, l could walk to Florida quicker than this.
Come on.
Sweetheart, could you keep it down? Someone just complained.
-Who? -Me.
Now zip it.
Thank you.
Channel 2 1 is all Barry White, all night.
Oh, baby, baby.
Flight attendants, please close the doors and prepare for take-off.
Yes! Excuse me.
l'm looking for my daughter.
Sweet niblets.
l was just making sure all the carry-ons were stowed properly.
No need to thank me.
Sensible shoes.
Good choice.
l really don't like you.
Please take your seat.
Thank you.
Miley? Mile? Mile? l was just visiting my grandkids in Palm Springs.
And you? Pardon me, doll face, gotta make a pit stop.
Roxy? Roxy.
Well, hello.
Robby Ray, what are you doing here? -Oh, no, she didn't? -Oh, yeah, she did.
She bamboozled us both.
Yeah, well, your bam is easy to boozle.
You still don't know l sneak over to your house and use your hot tub on the weekends.
What? Enough of this chitchat, let's find that girl.
Hi.
This bathroom's ocupado.
Sorry, doll face, you know, you're really supposed to keep these closed.
l may shift during flight.
Oh, you gonna shift right now.
Get out here.
Come on, Miley.
Get that thing off your head.
We're going home.
-But, Dad -No ''but.
'' Now.
Excuse me, ma'am, but we'd like to get off.
And l'd like a job where l don't have to smile all the time no matter how annoyed l am.
Now, the doors are closed and no one's getting off until our first stop in Denver.
So please take your seats.
-But -l said ''please.
'' Miley Stewart, l have never been so disappointed in you.
You think you're disappointed now, wait until you see your snack box in coach.
Listen, kid You have a fantastic sense of rhythm.
You must be very proud.
-Big dad? -Huge, with a Mohawk.
Gee, why would l want to hang out with my friends when l can spend five hours being kicked in the back by the Kangaroo Kid and drooled on by Jabba the Gut.
Don't blame me, blame your sister.
Why? You're the one that wouldn't let her go in the first place.
Don't start with me, Son, she wasn't ready to go.
She wasn't ready, or you weren't? -Excuse me? -Come on, Dad.
l mean, you raised us to believe that we could do anything we set our minds to.
The whole time we were growing up you told us, ''l know you can do it.
So get ready, get set, go.
'' Why aren't you saying that now? Oh, yeah, l can be deep.
Roxy, l really am sorry l lied to you.
Hush up, l'm not talking to you.
But if l was talking to you, l'd be saying, ''Don't apologise to me, apologise to your daddy, ''because he only does what he does because he loves you.
'' l guess l should apologise, shouldn't l? lf l was talking to you, l'd be saying l'd also say, ''While you're up, get me some two percent.
Roxy likes to dunk.
'' -l was just -Me, too.
Daddy, when l said l hated you, l was just l know.
Honey, sit down, l think we need to talk.
Oh, man, l was hoping we just said it all.
Not quite.
l think we both know what you did was wrong.
We can talk about that later.
Right now l have something l wanna give you.
A barf bag? lt has a song on it.
l just wrote it for you.
l know you didn't understand why l was acting the way l was acting.
l didn't understand it either.
Hopefully this will help explain.
She says things are falling in place Feels like they're falling apart l'm painting this big old smile on my face to hide my broken heart lf only she knew But this is where l don't say what l want so bad to say And this is where l want to But l won't get in the way of her and her dreams And spreading her wings She's at the starting line of the rest of her life As ready as she's ever been Got the hunger and the stars in her eyes The prize is hers to win She's waiting on my blessings before she hits that open road Well, baby, get ready Get set, don't go Darling, no daddy ever wants to see his little girl grow up, but every dad knows someday she has to.
When this plane lands in Denver, l'm getting off and you're staying on and going to Florida.

Besides, Hannah Montana don't need her daddy to hang around to go down and show that Mikayla what she's made out of.
Oh, Dad.
-Sorry.

Oh, no, shrimp and cookies, bad combo.
lt's okay, l got it all in here.
l'm gonna need a bigger bag! Lilly and l just watched the concert on Tv.
You were terrific.
And you blew Mikayla off the stage.
The important thing is, honey, you did a great thing for charity.
And you blew Mikayla off the stage.
Yeah, l guess Hannah did show her a thing or two.
And my daughter did the same for me.
l'm proud of you, darling.
-And you blew Mikayla off the stage.
-And you blew Mikayla off the stage.
Hey, Jackson, your sister's on the phone.
You wanna say hello? Can't right now.
Kind of busy.
So, trust me, Rico, couple of workouts on this bad boy and you are gonna be Mr lrresistible.

Well, let me just turn it up for you a little bit.
That was awesome.

-Bling.
-Bling.
And then you hate it, and got to start all over again.
Good.
You guys are still here.
Yeah, and trying hard not to be, so whatever it is you're here for, make it quick.
We don't have time for another bling crisis.
Well, l was just coming to wish Miley luck at the concert, which l won't be going to, again.
Oliver, you know if you want a ticket, all you have to do is ask me.
Great.
Can l have three, one for me and my two best friends? Wait a minute, they'll already be there.
Backstage, where l wasn't invited, again.
Dang it, Oliver, this is my favourite outfit, and now you're getting guilt all over it.
Don't worry, we'll open the windows in the limo, and it will blow right off.
-Let's go.
-Sure, make jokes.
l'll go home and laugh at them alone, again.
-Well -Miley, conference! You're not actually thinking about this, are you? Well, he's never been backstage to anything.
l know this is kind of our special thing, and you might be kind of jealous Jealous? l l am not jealous.
Yes, you are.
l am not talking to you.
Look, l just don't want you to be embarrassed, okay? And let's face it, he's just not as sophisticated as Lola Luftnagle, international jetsetter.
And l'm embarrassing? Fine, you're in.
What? l meant to do that.
Hey, yeah Make some noise, make some noise Make some noise Hey, hey Make some noise Hey, hey, yeah Hey, has Oliver gotten here yet? No.
He texted me he's having a little trouble putting together a disguise.
This ought to be good.

Good evening.
Let's pump some blood into this party! come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar?

Really? Was your wolfman costume in the cleaners? Will you relax? l'm sure everything's gonna be fine.
Stop enjoying this! Hey, this is the best l could do on short notice.
And if l was invited earlier, l would've had time to -Grow some fangs? -l forgot.
-Fix him! -Why can't you fix him? Once again, give it up for Hannah Montana! l'm a little busy right now.
Thank you! l love you, too.
Good night, everybody! So, where's Count Dorkula? Well, thanks to your brilliant friend, Lola, Count Dorkula is no more-kula.
Yo, l'm hanging with Hannah 'cause l'm more than just a fan-nah With her posse, l can mesh 'cause l'm fricky-fricky fresh Word You couldn't have found a costume that covered his mouth? What is that beard made of anyway? Armpit hair? You said nobody could tell.
Well, you're lucky l found this.
And by the way, l kind of promised your stage manager a raise.
lt's all good, Dougie D.
This is awesome! Thank you so much.
Watching from backstage was so lf you say ''fricky-fricky fun,'' you're going home.
Sorry.
l didn't get the rule book.
Okay, well, Hannah backstage rule number one, be calm.
Be cool.
Be -Anything but that.
-Look! Look! -lt's Guillermo Montoya! -He is so cute! You are such girls.
He's the number one tennis player in the world, and all you care about is how cute he is.
Yeah, what's your point? Hannah Montana.
Guillermo Montoya.
You don't have to tell me.
l know who you are.
l know you know, but l like saying it.
Montana, Montoya, Montana, Montoya.
You try it.
lt's fun.
-Montana, Montoya, Montana -Montana, Montoya, Montana Not you! Who are your colourful friends? Well, Guillermo, this is Lola Luftnagle.
You can call me Gui.
v ery smooth.
And, Gui, this is my friend Mike Stand.
Mike.
Stand.
Lee.
Mike Standly, the third.
And hopefully, the last.
Hey, l'm staying, and l'm playing till my hair starts a-greying.
My friends.
Aren't they something? Colourful.
Strange.
l love them! And l loved you on stage tonight.
You were like me on the tennis court.
A tiger.
Excuse me.
-He thinks l'm a tiger.
-He thinks l'm colourful! That just leaves strange for you, Mikey.
Doesn't sound good.
Even with that adorable accent.
ls everything okay? My celebrity partner for this pro-am sprained her thumb speed-texting.
Well, l just so happen to know a celebrity with a wicked serve and a very cute tennis outfit.
You're kidding! Hannah, if you can play, you're my new partner.
Well, then get ready to rally, 'cause you're looking at the girl that put the tennis in Tennessee! Fantastic! You don't play tennis.
And l don't skydive, either, but, honey, l'd jump out of a plane with that boy any day.
Excuse me, l'm very thirsty and l've lost my purse.
Wow, sounds like you have a problem.
That's good.
Please, l can't pay, but l'll gladly tell your fortune for a water.
l already have a fortune.
Why? Because l don't give away stuff for free.
You are an evil little boy.
Because your heart is cold, terrible things will happen to you.
Until you learn to be nice, you are cursed! What was that all about? Some scam artist tried to work me for a free water.
Now l'm cursed.
That was a coincidence.
Wow.
How about them apples? What in the Sam heck are you doing? l'm practising my grunt.
All great tennis players have a signature grunt.
Well, you sound like Uncle Earl doing his annual sit-up.
''Well, that ought to do it for this year.
'' Daddy, come on.
l can't help it if l'm pumped.
l am gonna be serving it up with the cutest guy in tennis! And it's all for charity.
Yeah, l was getting to that.
By the way, the people from the tournament called, they can only get you one ticket.
One ticket? Now l've got to choose between Lilly and Oliver.
This ought to be fun.
lt won't be no problem, honey.
Just tell them the truth.
They're your friends.
They'll understand.
-She's taking me! Tell him! -She's taking me! Tell her! Way to go, Dad.
Now, honey, l said they'd understand.
l didn't say they'd be happy about it.
-l'm going! -No, l'm going! -Miley! -Miley! Hey, look on the bright side, l think you found your tennis grunt.
Can l have another napkin, please? One per cone! You got a problem with that? Use your shirt! -You're mean! -You're mean.
Caterpillar! l almost ate that! You know, l accidentally ate a caterpillar once.
Week later, burped up a butterfly.
This isn't funny.
Flying caramel apples, caterpillars That embarrassing oil stain on the back of your pants.
What? l've been cursed! Jackson, you've got to help me! How? The fortuneteller said that you were cursed until you learned how to be nice.
And l think we both know that's never gonna happen.
Yes, it is! There you go, sweetie.
All better.
Yes! lt worked! l've got to go tell Grandma where l hid her teeth.
Bravo.
Bravo.
You were all brilliant.
And worth every penny.
Hey, Jackson.
-Can't wait for our date on Saturday.
-Me, too, Steph.
You did all of this just to get one Saturday off? Of course not.
Hey, Jackson.
l'll see you next Saturday.
l did it for all the Saturdays.
So, what are you doing in two weeks? l don't see me in your future.
You will kiss me or you will be cursed.
Heads, l take Oliver.
Tails, l take Lilly.
Come on! -Stop pushing! Get out of my way! -Move out of my way.
Hey! Hey, Miley, l made you a cake! Look, it has hearts on it.
Real subtle! Buttering her up with cake with hearts! Pathetic.
Hey, Miley, l made you a shirt! -She's taking me! -She's taking me! Keep this up, and neither of you are going to the tennis tournament tomorrow! Are you guys talking about the celebrity pro-am this weekend? Not now, Rico.
Because l have a ticket l'm not using.
l said not Teenie-weenie meanie say what? -You can have it if you want.
-What's the catch? No catch.
l'm going to be spending the day petting homeless cats.
Ladies and gentlemen, your guest umpire, TV's favourite talk show host, colin Lassiter.
Thank you.
And welcome to the United Peoples Relief celebrity Pro-Am.

You want to know how l know? Because l can hear y'all from all the way over there! -Sorry.

The main thing is you guys are my friends, you guys are here and you have awesome seats.
You're right.
And it's all fricky, fricky Are you kidding me? Oh, boy.
Hannah.
Excuse us, señorita.
One little itty-bitty thing, Guillermo Montoya never loses! -Never! -Never? Not even in a little charity game? You know, for fun? Fun is for losers! l'll take care of Roddick.
You make Dakota cry more than she did in that pig movie.
Hi, Dakota! Aim for her head.
l'm not gonna aim for her Okay.
Switch seats with me! -Gee, let me think.
No.
-But it's not fair.
You're lucky you're even here in the first place.
Now, stop talking to me.
lf you two are finished First service, Hannah Montana.
Hey, cutie with the tomato head, turn off the cell phone.
Sorry.
Forgot to put it on vibrate.
-Hello? -Switch seats with me.
You're pathetic.
Switch seats with me.
Switch seats with me.
Switch seats with me.

Knock it off! Love- 1 5.
lt could be a long day.
We're having some fun now! l thought you put the tennis in Tennessee.
l guess l just kind of left it there.
-Cute outfit though, right? -Not cute enough.
Honey, the court's over here.
Yeah, l know.
Just a loose lace.
Let me just take care of that over here.
Stop talking! You're making me look bad.
l wouldn't know.
l can't see.
Well, boo-hoo fricky-fricky hoo.
Excuse me, ma'am, do you mind taking off your hat? My friend can't see.
Of course.
l'm sorry.
Sweet niblets.
Hey, Rico, nice sweater.
lt's not a sweater.
l was petting cats all day.
Hey, Jackson, you ready to go? Yeah.
Just one sec.
Listen, boss, l got to leave a little early, so Don't give it a second thought, but before you go l promised a couple of Wilderness Girls l'd find them a ride.
Their mom's car ran out of gas, and they need to deliver their cookies.
Well, Rico, l'm getting ready to leave.
l was a Wilderness Girl once.
Jackson, go ahead.
l mean, l'll wait.
Okay.
l mean, two girls, how long can it take? Follow this nice man, kids.
l'll go help your mom unload the rest of the truck.
The truck? lt's been 45 minutes.
Switch with me.
No! l get the best seat 'cause l'm her best friend.
You mean her greediest friend! Well, it's better than being her dumbest friend! l'd rather be stupid than greedy.
Of course, 'cause you're stupid.
Will you two just work it out? l'm gonna remember that, Dakota.
-Steph, you're still here! -Jackson, what's that all over you? Cookies! l didn't drive fast enough, so the Wilderness Girls threw them at me, but, on the plus side, we don't have to buy candy at the movies.
Do you like Chocolate ButterClusters or FatMints? Wait.
l promised that little boy you'd get his kite off of that tree.
What? And then you have to help me get a beached whale back into the ocean.
-But -And also there's Wait a minute, l know exactly what's going on.
He hired you, didn't he? Didn't he? Jackson, what's wrong with you? That's right, cry! Cry, you little faker! You little Jackson, you're You're horrible! Wait, Steph! You don't understand! l hired a fortuneteller to scare Rico into being nice! Somehow he found out, and now he's trying to get back at me! Steph! Jackson, Jackson, Jackson.
All right, who told you? Actually, you did.
Just now.
-What? -Up until then, l didn't have a clue.
Now, l've got a lot of mean to catch up on, and you know what they say, cruelty, like charity, begins at home.
Well, with this serve, Roddick-Fanning could win the match, and let's face it, my dog and l could win the match.
l swear, if you cost me this match, l will go home tonight, dress up like you and hit myself in the face.
You have got some serious issues, my friend.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
l lost a nickel.
Keep it.
-What are you doing in my hair? -Sorry, my hand's stuck.
Well, get it out! Help me.
Like l said, you're pathetic.
Great, now l'm stuck.
You and your stupid rings.
-lt's a lob! l got it! -No, no, no.
-l got it.
-l got it.
l'm sorry l was jealous.
And l'm sorry we made this your problem when it was clearly Lilly's.
And mine.
And, next time Hannah has one ticket, you should go.
-No, you should go.
-l said you! -No, you.
You're impossible! -You're impossibler! Hello! Girl wrapped up in a net here! Yes, very interesting.
What do you see? You, dancing in front of many people.
Fortuneteller say what? l'm not much of a dancer.
l can see that, too.
But if you would just bend your knees That's it.
Give it a rest, woman.
l'm out of here.
Oh, sure, now you move your feet! 

How did l get here? l turned around and there you were l didn't think twice or rationalise 'cause somehow l knew That there was more Man, Miley is so lucky.
Her voice is so pure and natural and But l figured it's too good to be Okay, l know l had a chilli dog for lunch, but there is no way that's me.
Lola Sorry! My bad.
You're one in a million Oh, yeah How'd that sound, Dad? Perfect.
That is such a great song! Have l told you it's my mom's favourite? Hey, here's a wacky idea! Her birthday's coming up.
Maybe you could make a special kind of personal recording, and l could give it to her as a present? You spent all her gift money on those shoes, didn't you? They didn't have them in her size.
l hear you.
Last Christmas, l bought Daddy these earrings.
-See? This is why we're friends.
-Exactly.
So, you'll do it? You'll record the song? Nope, you will.
You're not kidding.
No, kidding is when l tell my dad that he looks good in that dorky moustache.
Your mike's still on, darling.
Love you! Lilly, to really make this special, you're gonna have to record the song.
But l don't have a voice like yours.
You'll be surprised what you can sound like in a professional studio.
Trust me, you're gonna sound great.
Okay.
One in a million So, do you think my mom will like it? Like it? She's gonna be speechless, right, Dad? You see? come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds They say that good things take time But really great things happen in the blink of an eye Thought the chances to meet somebody like you were a million l haven't felt this queasy since my grandpa dragged me into that shirts and skins b-ball game at the seniors' centre.
The skin was bouncing more than the ball.
l could've lived my whole life without that picture in my head.
You're not actually going to give this to her, are you? Of course not.
l'm going to give her this one.
They say that good things take time But really great things happen Wow, a little reverb, some overlay.
Nice.
Daddy called it ''Extreme Mix-over.
Lilly Edition.
'' Now she'll never know how unbelievably -Hi, hi.
-Completely wonderful she is! Listen to you, you singer, you! One in a million Oh, my gosh! l'm fantastic! Almost too good to believe.
But not.
My mom is gonna be so blown away.
l got to tell you, l was a little nervous.
Nobody in my family can really sing.
Yeah, heredity's a powerful thing.
For instance, my mom's feet always hurt, and now so do mine.
Hey, why don't you just listen to the headphones? You know, get the full effect.
l'm trying to do a nice thing here.
Lilly's happy, her mom's gonna be happy, who's it gonna hurt? You're one in a million Any creature with ears.
Yeah.
Go ahead and look, but you can't touch.
Dude, what happened to you? Did you get lost on the way to the bullfight? Go ahead and joke, but my father won my mother's heart dressed like this.
Your father's a billionaire.
He could've dressed like a duck and won her heart.
And what died on your lip? Stop it! She'll see.
This is all for Sarah? Come on, Rico, what'd that poor girl ever do to you? She stole my heart! l just wish l had someone who could find out if she likes me, too.
A friend, a pal, an easily replaceable employee.
All right, fine.
But lose the 'stache, or the next thing you know, she inhales it during a kiss, you become the laughingstock of the school, and you're forced to move from Tennessee to California.
Believe me, it can happen.
Hey, Sarah.
Nice pose.
Thanks.
lt aligns my chakras.
Well, you're gonna be in for a chakra when you hear what l have to say.
The President got my letter and agreed to give Arizona back to the Apaches? This'll go a lot faster if you just stop talking.
Okay.
Look, there's this guy who really likes you, but he's kind of shy, and he doesn't want to say anything until he knows whether you like him, too.
Oh, my gosh! Does this guy go to my school? Yeah.
And is he maybe not the tallest guy around? Yeah.
Jackson! l like you, too! No, l Okay, okay, all ninth graders, listen up! The circus l hired for the freshmen fundraiser is no longer available.
Last night, the fire-eater had a bad taco and burped the place to the ground.
But no worries.
One of our very own has come up with a brilliant, last-minute substitution.
Karaoke night Night! Karaoke night! They get it.
For admission, you get food, drink, and the chance to get up there and be compared to Me You! You.
They get it.
Well, now l know not all of us can sing as well as some people.
Stop pointing.
But l still expect to see everybody here and singing on Saturday night! Hey, it's either this or a car wash.
And, trust me, you don't want to see this business in a wet T-shirt.
Hey, Miley, if you're too gutless to sing, you can always go up there and do one of your pig calls.
You mean like this? ''Amber, Ashley, get in here!'' Boo-yah! That's weird.
Her pigs have our names.
Real mature.
Exactly what we'd expect from the tone-deaf twins! -ln your face! -ln your face! Well, what you don't know is that l happen to have a really great voice.
What? No! Lilly, you can't sing Up there, with Amber! Why not? Because l'm coming down with something, and l just gave it to you, sorry.
You two are coming down with something, all right.
Chicken pox.
Emphasis on the chicken! l put the emphasis on the chicken! What are you so worried about? You heard that CD, l can take her! Hey, check this, Twitney Houston, l'm gonna sing you off that stage.
Oh, it is so on! l'll see you Saturday night, Smelly Clarkson! You heard her, Celine Peon.
You can't ''Celine Peon'' after l ''Smelly Clarkson.
'' This is gonna be so great! When she hears my voice, she's gonna freak! She ain't the only one, honey.
Hit me again, Marty.
And this time, leave the carton.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the Sarah stealer, the babe bandit! Look, Rico, she came on to me.
Do you really think l want a 1 4-year-old girlfriend whose idea of a hot date is snuggling around a campfire roasting gluten-free marshmallows? l don't care what you want.
All l care about is Sarah and her happiness.
That's why l need you to crush her and send her crawling back to me.
Look, l am not gonna break her heart.
l'll find another way.
And aren't you lactose intolerant? What's it to you? Hey, Jackson! This weekend, want to go get typhoid shots together? Why would l want to do that? So we don't get typhoid when we go to build alternative housing in Tanzania, you silly goose.
Bye! l should be the one risking infectious disease in Tanzania! No arguments here.
Try to hit all of the notes l'm hitting all of the notes Miley, we've been at this for an hour.
l don't want to damage my voice.
Trust me, that ain't gonna happen.
l don't even know why l need to do these stupid exercises.
We both know l'm going to blow Amber off the stage.
This isn't about Amber.
This is about you being the best you can be.
But l'm already the best l can be.
l hope not.
l mean, there's always room for improvement, right? Hey, Lilly.
How'd your mom like her birthday present? She loved it Did you play it for her or sing it? She played it, her mom loved it, and now Lilly has challenged Amber to a sing-off in front of the whole ninth grade.
Yep.
l'm gonna sing l Got Nerve.
You sure do.
Help me.
You know, Lilly, your voice reminds me of another great singer.
Really? Who? Beyoncé? Shakira? -Johnny Cash.
-Really? Yeah, you just got something really special about your voice, something honest.
Where're you going with this, cowboy? Now, you see what Johnny does is he talks his songs.
Brilliant ly.
He talks his songs brilliantly.
We haven't met but that's okay 'cause l know you will be asking for me someday Chills.
-Okay, what's going on? -Nothing! -Got anything else? -Can she rap? Hello! Still in the room! -Daddy, maybe it's time that -Leave? lf you insist.
l was gonna say, ''Tell her the truth.
'' Coward! Hello.
What truth? This Help me before l get used to this guy What did you do to my voice? On this CD, nothing.
On the one you gave your moma lot.
You re-mixed me? Technology.
Gotta love it, huh? Oh, man, so this is how l'm gonna sound in front of the whole ninth grade? Thanks a lot.
Lilly! l'm sorry.
l was just trying to do something nice.
Like what, ruin my life? lf l don't sing, Amber makes a fool out of me, and if l do sing, l make a fool out of me.
What do you want from me? lf l could loan you my voice, l would.
Hit it.
Sorry.
l like to go for a big finish.
-You'll take what l give you.
-Yes, ma'am.
Jackson! Jackson, what're you doing? Just locking in perfection, baby.
l call it ''shellacsing the Jackson.
'' Gorgeous and water-resistant to 200 metres.
But aerosol sprays are ruining our ozone.
Aren't you worried about global warming? So my grandkids will never see a polar bear, big whoop.
l never got to see a dinosaur.
You don't see me crying about it.
Oh, man, l'm all out.
You can't just leave those there.
They have to be properly disposed of in a hazardous waste facility.
l've got a hazardous waste facility.
l call it the Pacific Ocean.
-But that'll pollute our beaches! -l don't care.
Aren't l horrible? You should break up with me.
Break up with you? You need me now more than ever.
-What? -This is perfect! l was feeling guilty about spending time with you when l could be saving the world, but now by spending time with you, l will be saving the world! Your hair hurts.
All right, look, look, l don't have a crush on you.
l never had a crush on you.
When l came to talk to you, l was talking about Rico.
He's the one who likes you.
He doesn't look like he likes me.
Sweet niblets! Excuse me.
What are you doing? Chilling with my new girl, Rosalita.
But what about Sarah? You were nuts about her.
l was.
Until l met Rosalita.
Sarah! Rosalita! Sarah! Rosalita! Ain't love grand? -Look, Sarah, l'm really -lt's okay.
lt's obvious you weren't emotionally ready for me.
Yes! Yes.
Thank you for understanding.
That's why l'll wait.
l waited six years for the California low-flow toilet initiative, and l can wait for you.
Bye! But l'm not worth waiting for! Ask anybody! -Yeah.
-Yep.
Okay.
She gets it.
Thanks.
We all want to believe in love We all want to believe in something Oh, man, she sounds good.
Yeah, but you're gonna sound better.

So l'll be singing in here, your mouth moves out there, and Amber's mouth just does this Got it.
Remember, l like a big finish.
l remember.
Just go and have fun! Singers.
They're all divas.

All right, who's next? -No way.
-Not me.
Boy, l sure wouldn't want to go up there and sing after someone that wonderful! Who could possibly follow Amber? l believe the gauntlet has been thrown down! Will Lilly Truscott pick it up? Give me that mike.
-You've got guts, kid.
-That's not all l've got.
l got nerve! Hit it, Oliver! We haven't met but that's okay 'cause you will be asking for Lilly one day Don't want to wait l didn't know she had a voice like that.

Your mom would've loved it, just because it came from you.

Lilly, this isn't funny.
You should've seen the way they glommed onto him.
''You are awesome.
Will you write a song for us?'' ''Yee doggies, l'd love to!'' He was putty in their hands.

Otis.

What are you talking about? Robby Ray didn't write that song.
He stole it from us.
He came in while we were rehearsing and said he was ''just listening.
'' Unbelievable.
-He ripped you off? -Totally.
Robby Ray hurt us, hurt us deep.
Way deep, man.
ln the gut.

Sorry, guys.
lt's your song.
Are we cool? We cool.

Funny you should mention him.
Sweet niblets.
What are we gonna do? Okay.
We still have a chance.
Maybe they'll be so angry, they won't even talk to him.
Right.
Okay, they're talking, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're telling him about us.
Okay.
All right.
How much longer? Just a few more minutes, champ.
You're almost there.
Hop, kangaroo boy, hop! -Hop! Hop! Hop! -Hop! Hop! Hop! Can't hop.

Ain't l a little stinker? Come here.
l'm gonna get you.
Doubt it.
Rico! No! Hey, Mile, l guess you know we're gonna have to talk about this sooner or later.
Don't worry, Daddy, Hannah already called the Jonas Brothers and told them that she hired Milo and Otis, and it was all a prank.
So you can run off and go play air hockey with your new best friends.
l'm sure it's a lot more fun than hanging around with boring old me.
Okay, see you.
Daddy! Honey, you can't seriously be jealous of me spending time with the Jonas Brothers.
You're having so much fun writing for them.
And that song you wrote's really good.
They're just gonna keep wanting more, Dad, and then other people will, and then And l won't have time for Hannah Montana? Or Miley.
Now, darling, let me tell you something.
You know, l could write a hundred songs for those boys, but there's one thing l can't do.
That's put my arm around them and say they're my little girl.
Well, l could, but it'd be extremely weird.
So you're not bored with me? Bored with you? l love writing songs for Hannah Montana.
Almost as much as l love being Miley's daddy.
You know, it is a shame you didn't like those boys, though 'cause l had this vision about getting them and Hannah Hold on, Pops.
l said l didn't like them spending so much time with you.
Now, with me? That would be off the hook.

You're right.

Daddy, l think you need to take the canyon.
The highway is jammed.
And how do l know that? Because l have streaming live traffic on my new O-Phone.
''Tomorrow's technology, today, today, today.

Man, l wish l had the O-Phone instead of this stupid Slim Flip.
''Look at me.

'' Man.
-Do you want the O-Phone? -Yes, l do! No, you don't.

Dad, the Z-Phone's not just a phone.
lt's full of dynamic digi stuff.

But l've grown! l have new phone needs! Tell him, Lola.
Why? So l can hear you brag about your new-new phone? Give it up for Hannah Montana! -Help me out and you get this one.

Darling, it's a phone, not a kidney.
You can live without it.
But But, Daddy Hannah! Loved your shout-out to the Z-Phone.
l just can't live without it.
You don't say.
Honey, did l ever tell you that when l was a kid, l had a one-eyed carrier pigeon who just flew around in circles? Kept bringing me my own note back.
l survived it.
Hannah, your daddy's so funny when he goes all Pony Express.
Well, l'm glad l can amuse you.
Now l just got to get out back there and saddle up the old limo.
Stop it! So, what's your Z-Code so we can Z-Chat and Z-Text? -Mine's still in zee box.
-Yeah, in zee store.
l'm having it Hannah-fied.
Like yours, but more.
lf that's possible.
-l can't wait to see it.
-That makes two of us.
l'm getting a Z-Minder.
Traci, time to leave for Amanda Bynes's beach barbecue to benefit baby belugas.
l'm just so grateful to live in a world where people like us can have phones like this.
l know.
Why did you say you have that phone? Simple.
l have the lQ of a peanut.
As soon as she finds out that l don't have that phone, she's gonna tell everybody.
''Beyoncé, did you hear? Hannah doesn't have the Z-Phone!'' l'll be a joke! l want that phone, l want that phone, l want that phone! Hannah has a hissy! Thanks, kid.
Can't you people ever give me a break? Sorry, kid! This picture's gonna pay for my new Z-Phone! l cannot believe this.
l made myself look like a total idiot, all because of that phone.
l'm on the front page! Don't l look so cute when l'm scared? lf you don't get over yourself in about three seconds, you're gonna look absolutely adorable! -Three seconds? That's it? -Take it or leave it.
-Fine.
-Go! Look at my hair! Look at my eyes! Look at my outfit! -l'm a star, l'm a star, l'm a star! -Time! Okay, l'm good.
lt's Traci calling on her new Z-Phone.
You know what? l'm just gonna tell her the truth.
lt can't be any more humiliating than this picture.
Listen, Traci, about the Z-Phone l call firsties.
Did you hear the dish on Dakota? She doesn't have the Z-Phone because her daddy won't let her.
lsn't that positively medieval? Yeah.
lmagine having a father like that.
l know! Svetlana, you're massaging my neck, not wringing out a mop! Anyway, promise you won't tell anyone.
Because you don't want me to embarrass her? Of course not.
That's my job.
Well, it must feel good to get that off your chest.
You know, life is a lot easier with a sense of humour.
Life is also a whole lot easier with that phone! You know, it's funny.
Just last week you actually did have the money, but you spent it all on those shoes and that purse and that Miley necklace.
Remember what l said about a sense of humour.
This is so unfair.
Some sleazy, disgusting paparazzi gets a humiliating picture of Hannah, and suddenly he has the phone l want.
Yeah, l know.
lf only we were sleazy and disgusting, we could take a picture of you and sell it.
What? How you doing, Sleazy? l'm Disgusting.
Hey, Dad, wish me luck.
l'm off to a shirts-and-skins volleyball game.
And, lucky for the ladies, l'm skins.
You got your wallet? Yeah.
Now.
How about your sunglasses? Yes.
Now.
-And did you remember to put on -Underwear! Of course! l'm not an idiot! l was gonna say sunscreen, but l'm glad to hear about the underwear.
Come on, Dad.
Do you really think you need to remind me about sunscreen? l live in LA, l go to the beach every day So you forgot.
l'll put it on when l get there! Stop treating me like a child.
Gosh! Jackson, is that you? How'd the volleyball go? What can l say, Dad? l was on fire out there.
That's my boy.
Now go shower up.
We got us some Tennessee football to watch! l think l'm just gonna go take a nap.
Nap? Stewart men don't nap when there's football on! That's what golf is for! Okay, l'll be right down.
-Hello? -Hello? Perfect.
No one's in here.
Okay, we can do this.
l'll call it Hannah, Before the Glamour.
-Take the picture already! -l don't know.
lt looks too posed.
That's 'cause it is posed! See, that's the problem.
We need to make it look more spontaneous, like you were taken by surprise.
We need to make it Hey, Mile, do you know what this thing does? l think l got a pretty good idea! -Hey, that could work.
-You think? And Tennessee football is on the air! Son, get your butt down here! lt's kickoff time! l personally love the look, but l think you need to put a little more boo-yah in your hoo-yah! Boo-yah! l love it! lt's embarrassing, humiliating, demeaning! -l know.
She looks like a complete idiot! -He gets it.
Congratulations, you just knocked ''Double-Jointed vampire Bites His Own Butt'' right off the front page.
Look at you.
The future of sleaze journalism.
l'll be right back with your blood money.
Man, l hope this Z-Phone is worth it.
lt is! And trust me, there's been a lot worse pictures of Hannah.
l don't know.
This one's pretty goofy.
l mean, your hair in curlers and your eyes bugging out, and your Miley necklace flopping all over the place.
Future of sleaze journalism say what? Oh, my gosh.
As soon as they blow up this picture, they blow up my secret! How could you have missed this? Me? You're the one who bought that stupid necklace.
lf you had gotten your name on a refrigerator magnet like l did, we wouldn't have this problem.
Here's your money, kids.
Thanks to you, in two days, that picture's gonna be on every newsstand in the country.
Yeah, about that.
See, we're starting to feel a little uncomfortable with the situation First-timer's guilt.
You'll get over that once you start spending that money.
Hey, have you seen those new Z-Phones? lncredible.
Yeah, l'm more of a letter writer.
Anyway, l really need that picture back.
You know what l need back? The hair l had in 1 980! lt's on my back now.
Life is cruel, get over it.
Now get out! Talk! -What are we gonna do? -l don't know! l don't want excuses! The Rock's in town for his new movie.
He's staying at The Plaza, and l need a picture that makes him want to crawl under a rock.
And then a regular photo.
My son's a fan.
We can get you a picture of The Rock.
-l'm listening.
-So am l.
l will trade you one humiliating picture of Hannah for an even more humiliating picture of The Rock.
Kid, if you can get me a picture of one of the world's most popular movie stars looking more ridiculous than your picture of Hannah Montana, you got a deal.
-Easy peasy lemon sleazy.
-Oh, boy.
Come on.
He breaks a tackle! He could go all the way! Touchdown! Time for another Tennessee Touchdown Stomp.
Again? Yeah! Son, what is the matter with you? l'm just a little stiff from the volleyball game.
Well, sit up here and let me give you a good, hard, Robby Ray rubdown! No! No, no, no, Dad, really.
l'm all right! Don't be silly.
What you need is a good old-fashioned deep-tissue massage from hands strengthened by years of steel guitar playing.
-All right, here l come.
-Here he comes.
-Get ready.
-Okay.
-Almost there.
-Almost there.
Okay! Okay! All right! l admit it! l'm burnt! l forgot the sunscreen! No! Wait a minute.
When did you figure it out? l heard you halfway up the beach, son.
Luckily, l know just how to fix it.
So how are you feeling? The milk starting to take the sting out? Yeah, actually it is.
How much longer do l have to stay in here? Mamaw said a couple of hours, but don't worry, l brought you a little snack.
Come on, Rock.
lt's time for your just desserts.
Are you sure? Good choice.
l could've stuck with weddings and bar mitzvahs, but no, l had to go for glamour.
-That's it, l'm out of here.
-Lilly, no! What? l don't look good in strawberry-cream pie! And l am not gonna look good with that big old honking Miley necklace on the cover of that rag.
Now, suck it up, we're going in.
-Can l help you? -Actually, we are here to help you.
We are your complimentary mani-pedi, hair and facial specialists, Mr The Rock.
The Rock.
Little bit of an airhead, but she's the Picasso of pimple-popping.
lsn't that right, Lillian? That's right.
No muss, no fuss, no pus.
That's me.
And l don't like pie.
Well, listen, ladies, l really appreciate it, but l don't have time for this, so sorry.
Good gracious, look at those cuticles.
You do not know how close you came to a hangnail, my little box-office sensation.
Well, l am gonna see my mom a little later, so l guess a quick buff wouldn't hurt.
-Maybe even a little clear coat.
-Now we're talking! Now, we will take care of everything, so just relax, close your little eyes, and make sure you keep them closed until the treatment's done.
Early opening could be hazardous to your health.
And ours.
-Promise? -l promise.
Pinky swear? That's a pinky? This feels like more than a clear coat.
Remember, it's got to look natural.
Trust me, they look perfect.
Why are you still putting stuff on my lips? l'm trying to save them.
They're dryer than the Sahara Desert in the summer.
-Lillian.
-Yeah, and blot.
Well, that tastes good.
What is that? ls that strawberry? And now, for a relaxing earlobe massage.
You might feel a slight pressure.
That's normal.
You do not know how much tension builds up in those lobes, honey.
That's working.
That's it.
-Yeah.
-That's the one.
-And now for the best part.
-Great.
A Himalayan temple massage.
Rocky likey.
What are you What are you putting on my head? Nothing.
lt's just a hair follicle extenuator thing.
-Well, what does it do? -You'll see.
Okay, and open your eyes in three, two, one.
Run! Hey! What Oh, my Hey, can't you people just ever give me a break? Run, run! l can't go out there.
Look at me.
l look like Grandma Rock.
-Come on, Miley.
Run! -l can't do it.
Left, right, left, right.
lt's just like walking, but faster! No.
l can't sell this picture.
l've been on the other side of the camera.
l know what it feels like.
lf l don't give him a break, how can l expect anyone to give me one? But what about your secret? l'd rather have everyone know l was Hannah Montana than know l was just as slimy as those paparazzi.
l'm not decent! lt's us.
You're not getting the earrings back.
Actually, l just wanted to say this was wrong and sorry.
And for the record, l knew it was wrong the whole time.
Okay.
-Why'd you do it? -Long story.
You can explain it while you're de-clawing me.
So all this started just because you wanted a Z-Phone? Yeah.
l guess l just got so caught up in having the next new thing.
You know, Miley, there's always gonna be something new coming around the corner.
Hey, that's what my mom says.
Not that you remind me of my mom.
You know, except for the nails, because these are her nails.
Here's your picture back.
l really am sorry.
Come on, Lilly.
Let's go.
But, Miley, without the Rock picture, how are we gonna get the Hannah picture back? Guess we're not.
ls there some kind of problem? Yeah, but it's my problem.
l've bothered you enough.
-Well, hold on, maybe l can help.
-Really? Well, sure, you did the right thing by me.
And that was the best facial l've ever had.
l mean, look at me.
Am l not glowing? Well, in that case, maybe there is something you can do.
Thanks for finally giving me my picture back.
Well, after l thought about it, l figured it was the right thing to do.
Good choice.
Hey, Jackson.
You can probably get out now.
That's okay.
l'm kind of enjoying it.
Aren't you getting lonesome out there? Actually, l made some new friends.
Slow down, Tiger, you're gonna get a tummy ache.
Sure hope nobody's lactose intolerant.
And, Boots, you're making a mess.
What are you, a dog? Sorry.

Hey, great things are happening here at the United People's Relief Telethon, thanks to you and to our amazing volunteers.
Look who we have with us this hour, teen pop sensations Hannah Montana and Mikayla.

Hate makes you ugly.
Too late.

Outstanding! l just got $400.
And l've got tears in my eyes.
We'll be right back, but you keep calling.
Hey, what's up? lt's Hannah Montana.

Bra-stuffer.

Why would l leave my little sister when she and her ex are gonna talk about relationships and feelings and You two kids have fun.
-Hi.
-You look great.
Oh, boy.
-Listen, Miley, l -l know.
l know.
You haven't been able to forget about me.
Your life feels empty without me.
You see my face everywhere you look, and you've come back to say l just want to be friends.
Big blonde sack of drama say what? You know, l've been thinking about it, and just because things didn't work out between us doesn't mean we can't still be in each other's lives.
So, you're not into me at all? Not even a little bit? l mean, come on, it's only been a couple of months.
What are you, made of stone? -Miley, if this is too hard for you, l -Me? Are you kidding? l was worried about you.
l mean, this is so great.
l would love to be friends.
-Yeah.
This is great.
-Great? lt's perfect.
Looks like somebody got up on the wrong side of the hamster wheel this morning.
The water's out at my house, and l haven't showered in two days.
So? We're guys.
We're not supposed to shower every day.
That's what magazine cologne samples are for.
Or car air-fresheners.
You put a couple of these in your pockets and you're good for four to six weeks.
-Like you've never done it.
-Here, dude, try this.
What kind of cologne is this? lt's not.
l spilled pickle juice on it an hour ago.
-You just got poned.
-Poned.
-You think this is funny? -Yeah.
Hence the laughter.
-Dude, get over it.
lt's only two days.
-l wish.
The plumber said our water's gonna be out for at least a week.
What am l gonna do? Grow up and release your inner man stink.
Your man stink.
Easy for you to say.
l bet you guys free hotdogs for a month that you guys can't go without showering or changing your clothes, until they turn my water back on.
-Free -Hot dogs? Dude, you are so on.
lt's gonna be like taking candy from a stanky baby.
Now, wait.
Wait.
lf we lose, what do you get? The satisfaction of looking at you guys and saying Did l mention l haven't brushed my teeth, either? Yeah, we kind of figured that out.
-l think l got some in my mouth.
-Gross, gross! And we're back on Wake Up, lt's Wendy with former zombie slayer and current teen-screen sensation, Jake Ryan.
That's right.
lsn't he just yummy? lsn't he? lsn't he? He is.
So, Jake, you're back in town.
You're here to shoot a couple of scenes from your new movie, Roger Bucks: lntergalactic Bounty Hunter.
You better set your phasers on ''fun.
'' Tell us all about it.
Right? Tell us.
-Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! -Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Okay.
All right.
Well Well, first, l'm really glad to have a few days in LA before we go to Antarctica to do the rest of the movie.
You know, it gives me a chance to spend some time with some really good friends.
You hear that? Great friends.
That's me.
There is no way you and Heartbreak Jake can be friends.
Yes, we can.
You know what? l think being friends is the best thing that's ever happened to us.
l mean, we can finally hang out without any of that relationship junk.
lt's so simple.
No more insecurity or anger or jealousy.
And l'm so excited to introduce the intergalactic alien babe that l'll be kissing for the next eight weeks.
Put your hands together for my beautiful co-star, Mikayla.
What? Well, that's our show for today.
We're gonna see you tomorrow when your alarm clocks will ring and say, -''Wake up, it's Wendy.
'' -''Wake up, it's Wendy.
'' Bye-bye.
And we're out.
-Thank you so much for having us.
-You're welcome.
You're very welcome.
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.
Wendy, you don't have to yell.
We're right here.
l know.
lt takes me 20 minutes after every show to stop talking like this.
lt does, it really does.
lt really does.
-Hey.
So, what did you think? -You were great.
That big announcement, boy, was that great and big.
Didn't see that one coming.
Yeah, l thought about asking, you know, Hannah Montana to play my love interest, but l didn't want to do anything that might risk the new friendship.
Little late for that, buddy boy.
So, you went with Mikayla instead of asking me because you didn't want to risk our new friendship? Exactly.
l mean, you know, how awkward would that be? The alien babe and l kiss from one end of the universe to the other.
l mean, it's like every single scene is kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss l got it.
Miley, l mean, you're not jealous, are you? Are you kidding? l'm happy for you, friend.
Pal.
You get any happier, you're gonna break my arm.
Hey, Jake.
-And l know who you are.
-You do? Of course.
You're Jake's ex-girlfriend.
Right.
'Cause we've never met or anything.
-Or worked together or anything.
-Lilly.
Well, you haven't.
Excuse me, Mr Ryan.
There's a couple of guys from the crew who are wondering if they could get a picture with you.
Well, l'm not gonna say no to that.
l just want you to know how amazing l think you are.
-Really? -Of course.
l could never watch my ex-boyfriend macking on another girl and stay friends with him.
Well, it's true.
l am amazing, and it's just a movie, right? Well, l sure hope not.
l mean, come on, he's beyond cute.
l can't believe you dumped him.
Yep.
She's just a little dumpster.
So, you're really into him? Are you kidding? l'm already working on our celebrity couple names.
Right now, it's between ''Jakayla'' and ''Mikake.
'' Too bad you're not old enough for Donald Trump.
You could be ''Old MikDonald.
'' Hey, you're funny.
Man, it's too bad you're not famous, too.
We could've been such good friends.
lt had to be Mikayla? Relax.
So what if she's into him? He may not even like her.
Are you kidding? Two months in Antarctica.
You're cold, you're lonely, and your snuggle options are between a penguin and her.
Do the math.
-So go warn him.
-l can't.
lf l tell him that l hate Mikayla, he'll just think it's because l'm jealous.
But you do hate her and you are jealous.
l am not jealous.
l am his friend, and as his friend, it's my job to get Mikayla fired off that set before they start sharing mukluks in Antarctica.
Please tell me your plan doesn't involve me.
-Oh, boy.
-Come on.
Here's your lunch, boy.
Come on, Dad.
This is stupid.
Can't l come back in the house now? No way.
You smell worse than that week-old sardine Uncle Earl found in his fat fold when he was looking for the remote.
Come on.
lt's just a little man funk.
What are you afraid of? Poor little guy, flew right through the stank zone.
-Hey, guys.
Hey, thanks for coming by.
-No problem.
We just wanted to wish you luck on your first day of filming, 'cause, you know, that is what friends do.
They're there for each other.
They support each other.
So, where's Mikayla? -ln Makeup.
Why? -We just wanted to wish her luck.
lt's not like we're here to get her fired or anything.
That's That's crazy talk 'cause Well, good luck.
Break a leg.
Gotta go.
Bye.
-You stink under pressure.
-Then stop putting me under pressure.
Listen, you flunky, Mikayla demanded extra cashews in her trail mix, and if there isn't a boatload of curvy nuts in her dressing room pronto, you're gonna be looking for a new alien babe, okay? -l don't like cashews.
-l know, but l do.
Mikayla, hi.
Great.
Little fans.
Security! l thought this was a closed set! lt's okay, Margo.
These are Jake's friends.
Hi.
lt's so nice to meet you.
What? Listen, mister, we had a contract, and it is legally binding.
lf l get home and your bedroom is not clean, you can forget about allowance.
Okay, bye-bye.
So, guys, what do you think of my costume? Don't l look fabulous? And check this out.
Kiss me, Roger Bucks, as if the fate of the galaxy depends on it, because it does.
That is so cool.
You know who would like that? Johnny Depp.
-Yeah, and he's right outside.
-What? Yeah, we were just talking to him, and he said he really wanted to meet you.
-He did? -He did.
-He did? -He did.

That's close enough! Hey! You showered! -You're clean.
-We won! -Yeah, baby.
-Yeah.
-No.
-No.
Congratulations.
Have a hotdog.
The first of many.
So, Rico, when did your water go back on? -lt was never off.
-What? And now, thanks to your man stink, l'm the only sweet-smelling guy within miles of this place.
And you're happy about that because Excuse me, l'm looking for the photo shoot.
The one for the swimsuit calendar? -Let me walk you over.
-Girls, it's this way.
-My goodness, you are so cute.
-You are so cute.
You set us up.
lt was like taking candy from two stanky babies.
Shall we? Hey -Come back.
l'm a Taurus.
-Oliver.
v ery good to meet you.
-Are you sure this is gonna work? -lt will.
As soon as l'm done being Mikayla, she's gonna be Mik-fired.
So evil.
lt's like you really are Mikayla.
Thank you.
Wow, Mikayla, you look great.
-That makes one of us.
-What? And l have to kiss you? Well, l guess that's why they call it acting.
Okay, look, l know you're nervous, but it'd really help me if you stop slamming me.
And it would really help me if you were better-looking.
-Okay, seriously -Okay, kids, now, in this scene, you have just discovered Lord Zordac's cloning chamber.
Okay? lt's tense, it's romantic, and l know they're not real, but these little bug-eyed things are kind of giving me the heebie-jeebies.
Okay, let's shoot this sucker and get out of here.
Okay? And, action.
We've got two minutes to destroy these clones.
But don't worry, Roger Bucks has a plan.
l hope it includes an acting coach.
That was pitiful.
Cut! What And, action.
We may never get out of here, so let me say this now and say it quick.
l don't care if your mother was a rainbow trout Hold that thought.
l gotta take this.
No, l'm not busy.
What's going on, girl? Cut! Okay, quick.
Throw me the flumium crystals.
You got two hands.
Get them yourself.
-What? -Cut! What is wrong with you? Those aren't the lines.
They're better than the garbage in this script.
Who wrote this, a monkey with a computer? l wrote it.
Yeah, we would've been better off with the monkey.
Mikayla, sweetheart.
What are you doing? l told you, you couldn't act like a jerk until your second movie.
Then what's your excuse? Yeah.
l went there.
Mikayla.
Mikayla! Listen, pop star, one more of your little diva moves and you're going to be off this movie.
Good to know.
What are you doing? -Turn it off! -Turn it up? Okay.
Oh, off! l want her fired! Took you long enough.
Get your hands off me.
l'm the star of this movie.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Don't listen to her! She's a A real alien! l told you l'm bad at this.
-Mikayla? -Yeah.
-Miley? -Sweet niblets! Mile, you must have known Jake was gonna find out sooner or later.
What in the world were you thinking? That Mikayla would get fired, no one would believe her story and Jake would spend two months snuggling with a penguin in Antarctica.
l had to ask.
Dad, l'm sorry.
Hey, l appreciate that, but, you know, l'm not the one you need to apologise to.
Sure, now he leaves me alone with a boy.
l cannot believe what you did.
l guess l kind of ruined the friendship thing, huh? Well, you sure didn't do it a whole lot of good.
Miley, if you were jealous, why didn't you just say something? -l was not jealous.
-Miley.
Okay, fine, l was.
Man, l mean, you don't want to be a couple, and when l try to be friends, you almost wreck my movie.
-What am l gonna do with you? -l don't know.
Maybe we should just forget about each other.
-Maybe we should.
-Fine.
Fine.
-Okay, this isn't working for me.
-Me, neither.
Look, last time, you were the one with some growing up to do, and now it's my turn.
But if l promise not to wreck another movie, can we try to be friends again? -l'd like that.
-Me, too.
-This isn't helping the friendship thing.
-Couldn't agree more.
Great work today, sweetie.
Seriously, changed my life.
-Mikayla.
-Security! No, no, no.
We're here to apologise.
l was jealous and stupid, and l'm sorry.
And l'm just a sidekick who needs to learn how to say no.
Wait a second.
Truth is, if l still liked a guy, l would've done the same thing.
Really? Well, l would've done it a little better, but l appreciate the attempt.
That was surprisingly nice of you.
You know what? l don't care if you're not famous.
-l'm gonna let you be my friend.
-Cool.
Sorry, not you.
Really, Mikayla, you don't have to Oh, my goodness, this is going to be so much fun.
We can do all my favourite things.
Shop, get our nails done, and talk about how much l hate Hannah Montana.
Let's start now.
Yay! Help! 

Y'all come back now, you hear? Thank you all for coming.
Great PTA meeting.
That vegetarian lasagne was delicious.
And those pork-free pork chops, that's some good eating.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
Dang it, honey, doesn't anybody in California eat meat any more? That's a large pepperoni, sausage pizza and a big old bucket of bacon on the side.
l'm sorry.
Did you guys want something? Now, Lilly, that's what l love about your mom.
Looks like an angel, but eats like a truck driver.
Was that supposed to be a compliment? From him? Oh, yeah.
Finally, they're gone! Dad, the next time you host a PTA meeting, at least do it out in the hot tub, so l can see Lilly's mom in The kitchen! Hey, Miss T! Warn a guy! And he doesn't have a girlfriend.
Go figure! Heather, l appreciate you and Lilly staying over, but you all don't have to stick around and help us clean up.
You just want that pizza all to yourself.
That is not true, but l will wrestle you for that bucket of bacon.
Why isn't he laughing? The man don't joke about his bacon.
Jackson, you could help clean up, too, if you like.
l am helping.
Man, this chocolate pudding tastes awful.
That's because it's Mrs Devahl's fast-acting prune butter.
Why do they call it Excuse me.
ls it just me, or are they actually starting to like each other? You mean like, or like like? l'll tell you, the best steakhouse in LA, Jimmy's down on Third.
One time l heard a cow say, ''When l go, just serve me up at Jimmy's.
'' -Like like! -Like like! Man, l haven't seen my mom even look at a guy since the divorce.
lt'd be so cool if they started dating.
lt would be even cooler if they got married.
-So how about Saturday? -lt's a date.
-We're gonna be sisters! -We're gonna be sisters! What are we eating? -Oh, boy.
-Oh, boy! come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds Make sure your dad wears his earring.
My mom says it makes him look like a pirate, and she loves her pirates.
Perfect! He's always looking for an excuse to wear his puffy shirt.
Lilly, tell your mom to wear that dress that she wore at my folks' Christmas party.
She looked so holidayish.
v ery festive.
l gotta go.
Okay, that was gross, but he's not wrong about the dress.
-True.
After you, sis.
-No, after you, sis.
Tell her not too much perfume.
And she's gonna have to keep laughing at his jokes, even when they stop being funny.
And trust me, that day will come.
Okay, perfume, jokes, Oliver's holiday dress.
You better write me a list, and l'll write one for you.
Cool.
Welcome to the wonderful world of international relations.
-Good one! -Well, thank you, Miss Truscott.
lt's always nice to be appreciated.
Now, next week, all of you will be ambassadors of an imaginary country, as we try to resolve problems peacefully.
-This is gonna work great! -Aye.
And it certainly will if everyone shows that kind of enthusiasm.
Stewart, Truscott, the two of you are a great joy to have in class.
Right back at you! Why are we a great joy? l don't know.
Keep writing! Something doesn't look right, but what? What could it be? Maybe it's the annoying little twerp staring back at you.
No.
lt's the sand around the shack.
lt all just, l don't know, blends in.
That's because we're, l don't know, on a beach.
Watch and learn, Jackson.
Or in your case, just watch.
Bring it in, Charlie! Sand.
You actually bought sand.
This isn't just sand.
lt's Costa Rican sand.
Finest in the world.
Feel it, smell it, unload it.
-Excuse me? -Remember to lift with your knees.
l'll lift with my knees, all right.
Now, this l'll be happy to unload.
Let me go! Jackson! Put me down! l'll put you down.
There.
Have fun hanging out.
Jackson, get back here! You're the worst employee in the world! That's because you're the worst boss in the world.
You wouldn't last a week working for a jerk like you.
And you wouldn't last a week managing a bonehead like you.
l bet you 50 bucks you couldn't even last the weekend.
Wait, you're willing to pay me 50 bucks to switch places? You are so on.
Fine.
For the rest of the weekend, l'm Jackson, you're Rico.
Now, get me down from here.
Sorry, Jackson.
Rico doesn't take orders from you.
Get yourself down.
Jackson! Whee, doggies, it sure feels good to be puffy again! Yeah, yeah, you're a regular puff daddy.
Okay, let's review, shall we? So she loves the Boston Red Sox, hates when people dress their dogs, -and her favourite ice-cream is -Chocolate crunchy.
Not chocolate crunchy, it's fudgy munchy! Sweet niblets.
How'd you get out of high school? By doing my homework, which is exactly what you should be doing.
Okay.
l'm sorry, Pops, but, l mean, it's you and Lilly's mom.
lt would be so cool Mile, l appreciate the coaching.
l know what you're trying to do, but let's face it.
l already got the duds and the 'do, anything else would be just unfair.
Okay, remember, he loves Car racing, Lynyrd Skynyrd and those Japanese game shows where people fall off logs.
l've never been so proud of you.
Lipstick check.
How you doing? We're very close.
-Move your finger, honey.
-Oh, right.
-That is one beautiful dress.
-That is one puffy shirt.
-Drive safe! -Next stop, Sister-town.
-Bye! -Bye! Man, Lilly, this is harder than l thought.
lf we just concentrate, l know we'll figure it out.
l've gone over these numbers 1 0 times.
Once you move in, there is no way all of our shoes are gonna fit.
Well, what are we gonna do? l guess l could give some away.
You would give away shoes for me? -You're the best sister ever! -l know! Hold on, l'm getting a video message.
People of Earth, people of Earth, people of Earth.
Don't be alarmed, it's Mr corelli! Just a gentle little reminder to all of you that lnternational Relations Week starts on Monday, so be prepared.
Francis, do you want one fish stick or two? Not now, Ma! l'm on the computer! Mr Corelli, over and out.
Four! And don't hog the tartar sauce! This explains so much.
Once we get our parents together, we have got to get that man a date.
-They're back! -They're back! l can't wait to hear how the date went! Me neither.
Slow down, slow down, slow down.
Give them a little space.
They'll let us know how it went when they're ready.
Okay.
How'd it go? Great? Perfect? Awesome? Fantastic? Tell me.
Fine.
l had a wonderful time.
So did l.
Let's go.
-But -The woman wants to leave.
Let's not stop her.
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.
What goofy thing did your dad do this time? My dad? How do you know it was my dad's fault? Have you met your dad? Yeah, l have.
And l've also met your uptight mother.
My mother is not uptight.
Lillian, move it! Yeah, she's a real ray of sunshine.
-This is not her fault! -lt's not my daddy's fault, either! l was gonna give up shoes for you.
-Well, now you don't have to.
-Fine.
-Good! -Goodbye.
She is not uptight! You know what? l don't need a sister.
l like being an only child.
Hey, Miles, l got a pimple on my back l can't reach.
Could you Let me go get my goggles.
Morning, Daddy! l made you breakfast.
Thanks, honey, but l'm still not gonna tell you.
What happened last night was between Lilly's mom and me.
And l respect that.
Really? So why did you write ''please, please tell me'' in little tiny pieces of bacon? 'Cause the full strips would've taken up all the room.
Sorry, honey, this just isn't your fight.
-You're gonna have to stay out of it.
-Get your own darn breakfast.
Fine.
Woman insists on paying half the cheque and won't take no for an answer.
-lt's ridiculous.
-That's why you're mad? l said l'm not talking about it.
Man tries to be a gentleman, and suddenly he's a caveman.
That's what y'all were upset about? Just because both of you guys wanted to pay the cheque? This is so awesome! l've got to go tell Lilly! And, Daddy, you might want to get the shells out of there.
l like my eggs extra crunchy.
Caveman.
She's the one that slapped down that credit card so fast, it got meat juice all over my puffy shirt.
-Lilly, l found out everything! -l know! l can't believe they fought over something so stupid.
l know.
Now we can still be sisters.
Yeah.
All your dad has to do is apologise for not letting my mom pay.
Uptight momma's daughter say what? l said your dad just has to apologise.
For what? Being a gentleman? Your mother's the one that needs to apologise.
For what? Asserting her independence? Well, she asserted it all over my daddy's little puffy shirt.
-Well, he was being pigheaded! -He was being polite.
Haven't you ever heard of Southern hospitality? Now get off my land! There, Rico.
That's the last of the sand.
Happy? Something doesn't look right, Jackson.
But what? What could it be? -Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.
The new sand does not please me.
Put it all back.
But l just spent two hours Unless you're willing to admit that you can't take what you dish out! Never.
Hold up, Jackson.
Let me help you with that.
Wait, l don't help anybody because l'm Rico.
-So you're Rico? -Yeah.
-And l'm enjoying every minute of it.
-Yeah? Well, l'm gonna enjoy every minute of pounding your face in.
-What? -You picked on my little brother -for the last time.
-What little brother? You remember, don't you, Rico? The kid with the unibrow, very similar to this handsome gentleman.
l believe you called it an eye-eye-eye-brow.
-What did you do? -Me? l'm not the one who said ''bring it on'' when the kid told you his big brother was gonna beat you up Sunday at noon.
Well, look at that.
Right on time.
Wait a minute.
He set me up.
He's Rico.
You just love picking on little kids, don't you? lt's true.
He's a bad man.
Look out! Move, move, move, move, move! Nobody does Rico like Rico.
And then she was like And then l was like, ''What?'' Chicks.
Hi, Oliver.
Ready for lnternational Relations Week? Totally.
My country, Okenland, is ready to rock.
We've got We got gorgeous beaches, gorgeous girls, and our main export is love.
Good for you.
Want to hear about Sarahtopia? Not really.
Our national colour is green, we only use alternative fuels, and our chief export is mulch made from our own waste products.
-You have an army? -No.
Good luck.
You won't be so smug when your people get sick of paying $ 1 8 for a gallon of gas, revolt and hang you by your thumbs.
Bye! -You're blocking my locker.
-You're blocking my locker.
Why don't you show some Southern hospitality and move? Why don't you assert your independence and move me? Okay, what are you two arguing about this time? Did somebody forget their friendship weekiversary? We don't have weekiversaries any more because we are no longer friends.
And this would've been our 200th, and Lilly would've gotten that charm bracelet she's been wanting.
Oh, well.
Well, l don't need presents from someone who insults my family.
-l insulted your family? -Thanks for admitting it.
l wasn't finished! Your cheque-grabbing mother Your me-man-you-woman pappy.
You know what you two need? A vacation on the beautiful beaches of Okenland.
Wear a bikini, get a free churro.
-This isn't funny! -This isn't funny! l said it first.
l can sing.
l can sing.
Welcome to the first day of lnternational Relations Week.
Today, four nations will demonstrate world trade.
Which will they be? Well, we have Okenland, Sarahtopia, Lillitania and Somebody else, somebody else, somebody else, somebody else.
Hello, Milantis! You know, today is a Milantian holiday.
Banks, post office, all closed.
Please respect our tradition.
Yeah, her old, backwards traditions.
Then again, Milantis is always ready to stand up for what it believes in.
And those beliefs will be tested in today's debate over a big pile of fish! Sorry, they're a little ripe.
l'm on a teacher's salary.
Now, you four nations border the Corellian Sea.
Milantis has had an excellent fishing season and, holy mackerel, owns all the fish.
What will you do to get what you need? Let's start trading.
Well, my country harnesses the power of wind.
We could trade you energy for fish.
Or l could just give you the fish, because in Milantis, that's the classy thing to do.
Well, in Lillitania, we don't take handouts.
We like to pay for our own fish and half the tip! lt's not a handout.
lt's a generous, loving gesture from the people of Milantis, but l wouldn't expect you to know anything about that, since you are from Lilly-tiny-brainia.
Well, at least my country doesn't sound like a cure for diarrhoea.
l'll take the fish if it gets me an A.
At least Okenland isn't threatened when someone wants to buy them one little dinner.
We don't need you buying us anything.
Lillitania is an independent nation! Milantis is a country rich in tradition! Now take the dang fish! l don't want your stinking fish! This one's mine.
Great, then this one can be yours.
-Cold fish! Cold fish! -Yeah, just like your mother! This one's for Mom! -Well, this one is for Dad! -No! -Lilly, chill! -Guys, l was gonna return those! Don't be an idiot, just take the fish.
Hey, if she wants to pay, it's her right.
-Well, her right is stupid.
-You're stupid.
Well, that's pretty brave talk for somebody without an army.
Who needs an army when you've got an arm? Gross! All right, that's it.
l want the fish, and l want them now.
Next time, we're trading cookies.
Guys! Guys! Can't we all just get along? Come on.
Those are expensive.
-l smell like low tide.
-Me, too na.
-Don't make me laugh, l'm mad at you.
-l'm mad at you.
-Flying fish.
-Flying fish.
-What are we doing? -Exactly what they're doing in there.
Fighting someone else's stupid fight.
Well, l'm ready to stop if you are.
Well, l gotta be honest.
My dad can be a little bit old-fashioned.
Yeah, my mom can be a wee bit uptight.
A wee bit? She's a lovely woman that can fight her own battles, just like my daddy.
-Friends? -Practically sisters.
-Eat it, Oken! -Help! l'm being attacked by Sarahtopia! Life's what you make it So let's make it rock Let's make it rock Life's what you make it So come on, come on Everybody now Let's celebrate it Join in, everyone You decide 'cause life's what you make it Life is what you make it -Honey, you were on fire tonight.
-l was, wasn't l? l think it's because l was so happy Lilly and l made up.
l think it's really great that you and my mom worked everything out, too.
Yeah, l know.
You think she had a good time at the concert? Rock and roll! Yeah! A little bit.

Loser.
How do you do that? Lungs of a singer, baby.
Which means Mamaw sleeps in your room.
But this isn't fair.
Why should l have to give up my room? Because you've got the lungs of a loser.
But she wouldn't even be coming here if it wasn't for your stupid award.
An lnternational Music Award is like winning an Oscar.
lf it was a stupid award, you'd win brains down.
Man, this is really gonna mess up your back.
Well, careful with that box, Robby Ray.
That's got my fancy wig.
l only air it out for parties and funerals.
Sorry, Mom.
And l can't believe you had the music on so loud in the car.
You didn't hear a word that l was saying.
Really? What in the world was l thinking? Well, you missed my whole story about that big old hairy mole that l had found on my Kids! Say hello to your grandma.
Quick.
-Mamaw! -Mamaw! There they are.
My handsome grandson and my beautiful granddaughter, the youngest person ever to win the lnternational Music Awards Female Artist of the Year.
By word, that is a mouthful.
No wonder those award shows are always so long.
Hey, hey, you know what else is long? The walk from my bedroom to the bathroom.
Miley's is right next door, and it has a view of the ocean.
See dolphins in the morning.
Would you give it a rest? She's in your room.
Mamaw, Sunday is gonna be perfect.
l am getting an award l've always dreamed of, Daddy's presenting it to me and now everyone l love is here.
You, Aunt Dolly Back this tractor-trailer up.
You mean to tell me that bottle-blonde, shrink-wrapped, five pounds of baloney in a three-pound bag Now, Momma, l know you don't like her, but Son, it is not just her butt l don't like.
lt's her head, her toes and everything in between.
Mamaw, this is the biggest award of my life.
Can't you guys just get along for a weekend? Please, Mamaw? Sweetie, l guess for your sake, l can look the other way, and l do mean the other way.
l don't even want to see that woman.
That might be kind of hard.
Why? We don't have to pick her up at her hotel, do we? Can't she just hitch a ride on one of her flying monkeys? We don't have to pick her up, Mamaw, 'cause she's staying here.
Award-winning granddaughter say what? Hey.
l can see dolphins from my guest room.
Well, shoot, that's nothing.
There's a snot-green blowfish right here in the living room.
Now, Ruthie, if you're gonna be mean, talk to the booty 'cause the hand's off duty.
Well, l would love to, but that booty has been nipped and tucked so many times, l just can't hardly find it.
Well, l ain't having no problem finding yours.
Family! So glad to have you here.
Good times, good times.
Yeah.
come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds So, this whole feud started over a boy? Yep.
lt was high school.
Mamaw was having a summer romance, and then Aunt Dolly bounced in and Well, that was pretty much all she had to do.
Mamaw never forgave Dolly for stealing the love of her life, Mr Elvis Presley.
-No! -Yes! -No! -Yes! -No! -Yes! Yes! Yes! Elvis.
Elvis with the pelvis and the hair and the ''hunk, a hunk of burning love.
'' Guys, l haven't slept all night, and my back is killing me, so, please, for the love of all that is good and pure in this forsaken universe, zip it! Good morning, everybody.
Well, Jackson, you lazy bones, get your rump out of bed.
Well, what do you know? Floor's more comfortable than the couch.
-Morning, Mamaw Stewart.
-Hey, Lilly, you cutie-patootie.
lt's too bad Dolly isn't here to see what a real blonde looks like.
-Mamaw -l'm sorry.
l'll chillax.
What? l'm Hannah Montana's grandma.
l gotta keep up on the teen scene so l can be fricky-fricky fresh.
Okay, now that is just wicky-wicky weird.
Hey, Mamaw, come here.
Will you look at my nails? What should l do for the awards show? Sparkly or non-sparkly? l think non-sparkly.
Sparkly just kind of feels trampy.
Hey, look at my sparkly nails.
Just had them done for the awards show.
Exhibit A.
Come on, Mamaw.
Now, you promised you'd be nice.
Aunt Dolly's being nice.
Well, of course.
l'm always nice.
At least that's what the King used to tell me.
You know l gave Elvis that nickname.
We used to always play checkers, and he would be like, ''King me, baby.
'' So l started calling him the King.
True story.
Now, Ruthie, there's no need to get your granny panties in a twist.
Why don't you come on over here? l'll give yours a twist.
Your family's better than cable.
Pull your claws in, Miss Kitty.
l'm just here to celebrate my goddaughter's big night.
And l am here to celebrate my granddaughter's big night.
That is my granddaughter, my kinfolk, a blood relation.
Now, l'm just gonna run and get my purse.
Then l'm gonna take you to find something beautiful to wear for your awards show.
How sweet.
Don't worry, darling, l'll take you shopping later, and l'll buy you something you'll actually want to be seen in.
Rico's public access commercial, take one.
And action.
Hey-o.
My name is Rico.
And this is Rico's.
Do you like hot dogs? We've got hot dogs.
Do you like Cut! Cut! Okay, maybe l was a little nervous.
lt was my first take.
l'll loosen up.
Just give me a minute.
Hey-o, l'm Rico! Hey-o, l'm Rico! Okay, l'm good.
Rico's public access commercial, take two.
And action.
Hey-o.
My name is Rico, and Cut! Cut! Stupid.
Stupid.
No, you're not stupid.
You just can't act.
Face it, Rico.
We need a better Rico.
Fine.
Who's first? -Hey-o! Hey-o! Hey-o! -Hey-o! Hey-o! Hey-o! Okay, open your eyes.
Wow, your mamaw has better taste than l thought.
Aunt Dolly bought me this.
Mamaw bought me this.
Wait for it.
With lights! l thought having both of them here would make this night perfect, but now, l just can't wait for it to be over.
What am l gonna do? Well, too bad you can't just put them in front of a mirror and show them how ridiculous they look.
Wait a minute.
l got an idea.
Okay, that was weird.
-E-7.
-Miss.
Again.
-A-2.
-Hit.
Again.
Dang it, woman, l'm your son.
Doesn't that account for anything? No.
Excuse me, l'm a little hungry, but l was just wondering if l should eat this apple before lunch? -B-4? -Hit.
-A-3.
-Miss.
Excuse me, could you tell me where l might find a napkin? 'Cause l don't see one.
All right, l will tell you what l see.
The woman who put the old in the Grand Ole Opry.
-You sank my submarine.
-He did that.
Crying out loud, he couldn't beat me at tiddlywinks.
Let that live forever.
Don't you walk away from me, you shrink-wrapped, rhinestone hillbilly.
Let it go, you sour old prune.
You are just mad 'cause Elvis chose me.
He didn't choose you.
You stole him, you big-haired, two-timing yackity-yodeller! Well, l'd rather have big hair than a double-wide backside.
Well, at least l don't have a triple-wide ego and a mouth to match.
Ladies, please, you're all shook up.
Don't be cruel.
You gotta take all that anger and return to sender, baby.
Elvis, didn't you love me the most? Well, pretty mamas, when it comes down to it, l would've traded you both for a fried peanut butter and banana sandwich.
So you mean to tell me we've been fighting all these years for nothing? And forgetting that we both married wonderful men? And we should just stop arguing and celebrate Miley's big night? Yeah, yeah.
l believe it's your turn now, ladies.
Well, don't that beat all.
Well, don't l feel foolish.
How come l never thought of ''yackity-yodeller''? That one's a keeper.
l'm gonna do you a favour.
l'm gonna pretend like l didn't hear that.
Kind of like you've been pretending for the past 30 years that that's your real hair? You wanna dance, mamaw? Well, bring on the music.
-Bring it on, blondie.
-You just Okay, stop it.
l love you both, but l guess you don't love me enough to stop this.
And if this is how you're gonna act, l don't want either of you guys there tonight.
ln fact, why don't you both just go home? Sweetie, could we talk to you for just a minute? Why? Well, because you really are important to us, angel.
And if you'll let us come to the awards show, we promise to behave.
We really will.
Why should l believe anything y'all say? Well, we'll prove it to you.
Ruthie, does this outfit make me look trampy? No, not at all.
Wait a minute, l can do better than that.
Mamaw, it's okay.
You're trying.
That is all l've ever wanted.
-So, we can come? -lt would mean the world to us.
Fine, but l'm picking out my own outfit.
-But -But -Okay.
-Okay.
Hey-o! My name is Rico.
And this is Rico's.
Do you like hot dogs? Well, we've got the best hot dogs in town.
Perfect! He's great! l'm not feeling it.
He doesn't have the right look.
Are you kidding? He could be your brother.
l am his brother.
Now that's a Rico.
ln what world? Let's just see what he's got.
Whenever you're ready, beautiful.
lt's like looking in a mirror.
Hey-o, my name's Rico.
Okay, l know how to fix this.
l'm Rico.
And l'll be waiting for you.
Hey-o! l am ashamed to be a part of this.
Nothing sells hot dogs like some sweet relish.
Okay, Daddy, now remember, when you introduce me, it is not about you.
You get on and get right back off.
Just for that, l'm gonna tell them how you used to put that diaper on your head and run around the house.
''Captain Diaperhead.
'' They're gonna love that.
That is exactly why l brought pictures of you in your chubby years.
Fine.
Captain Diaperhead triumphs again.
Now presenting the award for Female Artist of the Year, award-winning singer and songwriter, Robby Ray.
Hey, you guys might want to go take your seats now.
No, l'm fine right here.
l wanna be the first one to hug you when you come off that stage.
Well, l wanted to be the only one wearing pink, too, so it looks like we're both gonna be disappointed.
Well, we'll hug her together.
What a nice idea.
l'm watching you.
Fifteen years ago, l was lucky enough to win Artist of the Year, and tonight it is my honour to present this to my own daughter.
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Miss Hannah Montana! Thanks, Daddy.
l couldn't have asked for a better introduction.
l have to say that.
He's my ride home.
You know that girl has such a wonderful sense of humour.
She got that from my side of the family.
Really? l always thought she learned how to get a chuckle out of an audience from watching me on stage.
''Watching me on stage.
Me, me, me, me, me.
'' This is such an incredible honour, and getting it from my dad makes it all the more special.
You know, actually, l never really thought you were all that funny.
Well, Elvis thought l had a wonderful comic mind.
l know what Elvis was thinking about and, honey, trust me, it had nothing to do with your mind.
-You take that back.
-You make me.
And what makes this night perfect is l can share it with the two women who've inspired me with their character, strength, and, of course -Man-stealer! -Sore loser! their class.
l can always count on these two very special ladies to stop what they're doing when l need them.
l remember when l got my first review.
They both cut it out and sent it to me.
They sent me so many clippings, l finally just had to say Enough already! l'll be right back.
Jackson, l leave the room for two minutes and you turn on wrestling.
Flip back to the awards show.
This is the awards show.
That's gonna leave a mark.
You guys promised.
Now, break it up.
Wow.
Your family really is better than cable.
Once again, l would just like to thank you so much for this award.
l mean, this award.
Sweet niblets.
l hope you two are happy.
Good night, everybody! Miley, slow down.
l think l broke a heel.
Yeah, well, l think l broke a hip.
Will you two stop it? You turned one of the best nights of my life into some kind of granny smackdown.
Miley, sweetie, how many times do we have to say we're sorry? You can say you're sorry a million times, but l will never forgive you.
l learned that from the best.
Mile? Great night, huh? Hey, listen, darling Dad, don't ask me to go out there and forgive them 'cause l won't.
l don't blame you.
l think those women actually dislocated my shoulder.
l wouldn't blame you if you never spoke to them again.
Good, 'cause l'm not.
Good for you.
Why should you treat them any different than they treat each other? Where are you going with this? Well, wherever your heart tells you l'm going.
Think about it.
l hate when he goes all fortune cookie on me.
l'll put your luggage in the car.
Gee, l wonder what's wrong with my shoulder.
That's right.
l was body-slammed into the stage door.
-Sorry about that.
-My bad, sweetie.
-Well, l guess she's not coming down.
-l don't blame her.
Hey, don't go yet.
l'm still incredibly mad at you.
-l don't blame you, sweetie.
-Me, neither.
But that doesn't mean l'll never forgive you.
Because if l don't, l lose you, and l've seen what that looks like.
So you all can go on hating each other, but l'll never hate you.
l don't think the two most important women in my life would want me to act that way.
She's a pretty remarkable girl, isn't she? Yes, she is and smart, too.
You know, l am kind of tired of acting this way.
So am l.
Hating burns up a lot of energy.
Thirty years' worth.
What do you say we start trying to be nice to each other again? Well, l'd like that.
Hello.
Squishing the pop star.
Sorry.
l didn't say l didn't like it.
You're a true friend You're here till the end You pull me aside when something ain't right Talk with me now and into the night No need to pretend You're a true friend 

And, as the male bear says hello to the female bear, another mating season begins in the Alaskan wilderness.
Okay, inappropriate! l'll be right back, Beary-boo.
Don't slouch.
Could you please not be such a girl? Wasp! Big wasp! Take that, wasp! Not in my house! Where's Beary? come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds You monster! lt was an accident! Easy for you to say when you whacked the only witness.
This was cold-blooded bearicide.
Come on, Miles.
He's just a stuffed animal.
l'd cover his ears, but they're gone.
All right.
Fine.
l will buy you a new one.
How? This is not just a stuffed animal, it's a part of my childhood.
The move from the crib to the big girl's bed, the measles, the mumps, the potty-training, he was there through it all.
We were all there for the potty-training.
''Look what l did, look what l did!'' That was an important moment for me.
Stupid directions.
lt's just a bookshelf, not the dang space shuttle.
You kids know anybody who speaks Portuguese, Dutch or ls this Hebrew or Chinese? Daddy! Look what Jackson did to Beary.
lt was an accident.
There was a wasp.
-Where? -See? Daddy! l'm sorry, honey, but you know l'm allergic.
And those little buggers are just drawn to my Brazil nut conditioner.
Dad, can you forget about your hair for, like, 1 0 seconds and help me here? Oh, no.
l don't know if this is your stomach or your butt.
Hey, l'm sorry, darling, but you're in high school now.
Don't you think you're a little too old to be waiting this long for your brother to apologise? Do it, boy! Miles, l'm sorry about your bear.
May he rest in pieces.
Come on, he's a toy! He was also my friend.
And he will be avenged! Avenged, l tell you.
Get ready for the only thing worse than Jackson, his room.
-Are you sure this is safe? -Absolutely! lf you're a sewer rat.
What are you doing? l want to say goodbye to my mom, just in case.
Suck it up! We gotta find something Jackson really loves.
Anything worth loving would die in here.
That is not funny.
Hey.
What about this? Oh, no.
lt's not good enough.
When Jackson sees that it's gone, it has to hit him right in the gut.
Like when l lost Beary Bear.
Let it out.
Let it out.
lt's not that.
There's a stench over here that's making my eyes water.
Who puts raisins on pizza? And why are they moving? Get it! Miley, we gotta hurry.
Jackson could walk in anytime.
lt's all right.
l got Oliver on Jackson duty.
Speaking of Jackson doodie Oh, no, it's okay.
lt's just chocolate pudding.
-Favourite fruit? -An apple.
-Second favourite fruit? -A pear.
Third favourite fruit, and remember, you've already used apple and pear.
This is the dumbest survey l've ever heard.
l'm going home.
No, you can't.
This is for half of my grade.
ln what class? Sociologicology.
Favourite word? Wait a minute.
l know this one.
Goodbye! No.
l still have to test your reflex skills.
Catch me.
Dude, l'm trying to get away from you.
Why would l want to catch you? Because Because l just did this.
Those are excellent reflexes! What's Rico doing in Jackson's room? Something Jackson loves.
Something Jackson loves.
Never gonna happen, my friend.
-Hey.
What about this? -Careful! That is Jackson's autographed Joey vitolo baseball.
lf anything happened to that, he'd freak.
Hello.
Yeah? What? Oliver says Jackson's on his way home.
How much time do we have? Stupid, weird kid.
Not much.
-You do not want to go in there! -We've got no choice.
No! Towel, towel lt's a good thing l straightened up.
l cannot wait to see the look on Jackson's face when he sees the shredded remains of his stupid little ball.
''My ball.
My precious little autographed baseball.
'' -Still dizzy from Jackson fumes? -A little bit.
Hey, what's your dad doing out there? l don't know.
Building a bookshelf or something.
That is so cool he knows how to do stuff like that.
Dang niblets! Sweet flabbit! A ''glungshtacken'' does not fit into a ''flogenhagen''! Hello, ladies.
-Hi, Dad.
-Hey, Mr Stewart.
Having fun? You betcha! Just doing what men do.
You know, building stuff and loving it.
Have you, by any chance, seen the first aid kit? -Upstairs closet.
-Thanks.
Okay, vitolo.
You are about to go from a great player to a grated player.
Miley, are you sure you wanna do this? l mean, the whole Beary Bear thing was an accident.
You're right.
l'll make it ''look'' like an accident.
l am in the mood for some grated cheese.
And here's something that looks like a fancy gourmet cheese ball.
Come on, do it! Do it, you manicured little wimp.
Come on! What's the matter with me? Why can't l do it? Face it, you're just not that kind of person.
You're right.
Why do l always have to be so good? l can't even look at this any more.
You take it.
No! -Now that's what l call an accident.
-You're right.
lt is almost like it was meant to be.
l have a destroyed bear, and now he's got a destroyed ball.
Once again, the universe is in balance.
-Hey, Miles.
l got your bear fixed.
-What? Yeah, well, l was thinking, if you wrecked something of mine, even by accident, l'd be pretty mad, too.
So, there you go.
Hope this lets me off the hook.
-You are most definitely off the hook.
-Cool.
And l am so on it.
And l didn't think l could do it.
And l was so right.
Okay, look.
lt may not be perfect, but, you know, in a certain kind of light, if you tilt your head and close your right eye, then close your left eye Yeah, that works! You guys, what's the big deal? lt's just a signed baseball.
Go to a collectors shop and get a new one.
What is it, a Babe Ruth or a Willie Mays? No.
lt's just some guy named Joey vitolo.
This was a Joey vitolo? What kind of an animal are you? l'm not liking where this is going.
He's the only guy in history to hit five home runs at his first five at-bats.
Then how come l never heard of him? Because on his last home run, he did a cartwheel to celebrate, tore up his shoulder and never played again.
Now he owns some pasta place in Pasadena.
A pasta place in Pasadena, that's perfect.
lf you're thinking about getting his autograph, good luck.
Since the cartwheel ended his career, he won't sign anything.
Last year, l tried to get his autograph on a napkin He blew his nose into it.
ls that the thing you have framed in your room? And someday, it'll be worth a fortune.
No offence, Oliver, but you're a guy.
Trust me, when a sweet innocent girl like me asks, he has got to say yes.
No.
But my brother's ball is ruined.
Well, in that case, no.
Now, you're gonna order some ravioli or beat it.
-But she was just -Bye.
-But you don't -Bye-bye.
-All l need -Bye, bye, bye.
Come on, Joey.
Don't you care about your fans? Once again, no.
l gave them the best eight-and-a-third innings of my life, and you know what l get? -l'm the punch line on cable sports.
-lt's true.
When a player does a face plant, they call it a vitolo.
lt's terrible.
You know what? As far as l'm concerned, that part of my life is over, all right? The only things l really care about is linguini, lasagna -Daddy.
-And my little girl.
Hello, sweetheart.
-Hi, sweetie.
What's your name? -Angela.
Angela! What a beautiful name.
How about you get your daddy to sign this ball? How about you order some ravioli or beat it? That's my girl! Yeah, adorable.
Hey, Miley, check out the shirt.
Yeah, l think we have a little Hannah Montana fan here.
She rules.
-Really? -Totally.
Okay, ready? She's got the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when she Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it.
Hey, you don't have to listen to it 50 times a day.
-Wanna bet? -Wanna bet? Hey, sweetie, if l could bring Hannah Montana down here to meet you, could you get your daddy to sign this baseball? -You know Hannah Montana? -Losing feeling, losing feeling.
Nice try, kid.
But l don't care who you bring in here, because l'm not signing anything.
Losing feeling, losing feeling.
He'll sign.
Oh, hey, Dad.
How's that bookshelf going? lt's really cooking now.
-Want a weenie? -l'll pass.
You sure? lt's flogenhagen-flavoured.
A little used.
A lot of used.
There's my pudding.
My ball.
My Joey vitolo! Miley.
l will be avenged.
Yes! l will be avenged.
l don't remember raisins in that.
Not again.
And there you go.
Okay, l've signed every visible part of your daughter's body.
Now, will you please just sign my friend's ball? Sure.
No problem.
Right after the show.
What show, Joe? Hit it, Paulie.
No way.
This was not part of our deal.
You do a few numbers, you tell them to try the veal and you're out of here.
This isn't fair.
You promised my friend you would sign their ball if l met your daughter! When you're right, you're right.
Not a problem.
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
This just says ''Joey.
'' lf you want the ''vitolo'' part, you're gonna have to get your old blue jeans up there and make some noise.
''Old blue jeans,'' ''make some noise.
'' You get it? Fine.
But you are setting a terrible example for your daughter.
l can live with that.
-Why are there two microphones? -lt's funny you should ask that.
There.
Don't upstage me, kid.
lt's my restaurant.
Fine.
But l ain't pushing the veal.
l thought you were gonna say that.
Oh, yeah! Try the veal! You will tell me what l want to know.
The choice is whether you will tell me before the pain or after! Now, where is the ball? What ball? The Joey vitolo my dad gave me for my 1 3th birthday! That ball.
-l don't know what you're talking about.
-Fine.
Perhaps a trip to the closet will jog your memory.
You'll never get me to squeal.
You're right.
You are strong.
But he is weak! Oliver, don't let him break you! lt's okay.
lt's just a closet.
What is that? No, no, no.
Help me.
She's at vitolo's.
Tai chi practices Snowboard champion l could fix the flat on your car l might even be a rock star Thank you! And now, a special Vitolo treat, almost as sweet as the cannolis.
The musical stylings of Montana and Vitolo.
Vitolo and Montana.
Don't let no small frustration Hey! Ever bring you down That's right, babe.
Just take a kooky situation And turn it all around l'm talking 60.
With a new attitude everything can change Like the Sunday brunch, now featuring an omelette bar.
How you want it to be Black forest ham is extra, honey.
Life's what you make it So let's make it rock That's right, kids.
Life's what you make it So, come on Try the veal.
-come on -come on -come on -come on come on Yeah All right.
Now here's the break down.
come on.
-What? -Yeah.
Just follow my lead, all right? lt's good.
lt's good stuff.
Come on.
Come on.
Hannah, what are you doing? What does it look like l'm doing? l'm trying your daddy's veal.
Hey, what are you doing? You're embarrassing me.
You better pull yourself together for the second show.
Washed-up ballplayer say what? l got an agent and a record producer coming, all right? You want that ball, you better make me look good, all right? A Justin Timberlake mask couldn't make you look good.
-Do you know who l am? -Yeah.
You're the guy l used to look up to.
Now you're just some jerk who's taking advantage of my friend.
Come on, let's go.
But l ruined your ball.
l know.
And l know it was an accident.
And it's okay, l'm letting you off the hook.
Jackson, hold on.
Wait.
l don't understand.
l didn't let you off the hook.
l wanted you to suffer.
l saw that last number.
l think we've both suffered enough.
-So you don't want your ball any more? -Nah.
No autograph is worth this.
Thanks.
Hold on! l forgot something.
Hey! -Hey, Joey.
-Yeah.
-Ready for the big finale? -What finale? Yours.
One meatball to go! Right in the cannolis.
You know, it was awful nice of you to forgive Mr vitolo.
Well, after he finally signed the baseball and he apologised, l figured it was time for me to let him off the hook.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
l promised Joey one last song.
Hit it, Paulie! That's weird.
Joey's signature is different this time.
On the ball you gave me, the ''Y'' was all curly, you know, kind of like the way you do yours.
Hey.
You know if l could dance like that, l'd give myself a 1 0.

Sorry, carl, the answer is six.
That means you are dumber than a dog.
Wow.
When is this not on? Next up, a cD from rapper White Gold.
Or should l say, Warren Goldblatt? Another prep school poser whining about how hard it is out there to be a gangsta.
-Barney Bittman.
l love that guy.
-l love this.
Are you guys serious? He trashes practically everybody.
l would not waste two seconds on that squinty-eyed little weasel.
coming up, a cD from teen pop sensation, Mikayla.
Or should l say, teen poop sensation? Move over and hit ''record.
'' lf cupid had a heart he would make you fall You'd fall in love with me in no time at all lf cupid had a heart lf Cupid Had A Heart.
Give me a break.
lf Mikayla had a heart, she'd stop singing.
But l did buy two of her cDs and they were fantastic at blocking out her moose calls.
Crush her, Barney, baby.
coming up next week, l review yet another teen pop sensation, Hannah Montana.
Whoop-dee-do.
Barney Bittman? Whose career is that squishy-faced snake going after this time? come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds Daddy, there is no way l'm letting Barney Bittman review my concert.
Can't l just have the flu? Mile, why are you letting this guy get to you? What's the worst thing he can say? Well, how about, ''Hannah Montana, what did that poor state ever do to you?'' You know, that sounds exactly like something he would say.
-Miley's right -Where? -And it would be terrible.
-lt'd be just awful.
And, honey, it wouldn't matter.
You said yourself, the guy's a jerk.
Yeah, but he's a jerk who knows good music.
And if he doesn't like me, then maybe l'm no better than Mikayla.
Miley Stewart, you don't believe that any more than l believe calling a snail ''escargot'' is gonna stop it from tasting like a salty loogie.
You know, as gross as that sounds, l have to agree.
He's right.
Miley, you're way better than a salty loogie.
Fine.
l'll do the concert.
But if Barney Bittman's going to be there, this has got to be the best show l have ever done.
All week l am going to rehearse.
No distractions, no interruptions Surprise, surprise! -Uncle Earl! -Earl! l ran over this in Texas.
Who wants to grill it up? Sweet niblets.
Whoo doggies.
Look at this place.
You folks sure live high on the hog.
Speaking of hogs, l can't believe you brought Cuddles.
Well, l needed someone to keep me company.
lt was either him or Aunt Pearl.
And this one doesn't need to stop every 20 minutes to tinkle.
-Hey, Uncle Earl, what's this? -That's Cuddles' tinkle box.
You are such a wimp.
-Take it back, take it back.
Take it.
-Stop it! lt's getting on me! lt's getting lt's seeping through my clothes.
Daddy, you know l love Uncle Earl, but how am l going to focus on my concert with him here? Mile, l wouldn't even worry about it.
lf l know Earl, all he's going to want to do is run around Hollywood with a map of the stars' homes and play Celebrity Ding Dong Ditch.
Like you did when we first moved here? Good times, good times.
Yeah.
So, Earl, what do you want to do first? v enice Beach, Hollywood Sign, maybe play a little Ding Dong Ditch? That sounds tempting, but l'm out here on a mission.
l'm gonna be a rock star.
-What? -What? l know it sounds crazy.
But Robby Ray, you followed your dream.
l always kick myself for giving up on mine.
l mean, look at us.
Remember when l was the hot one? -He was the hot one? -No, it's true.
Uncle Earl was the prom king and Dad had a unibrow.
Sexiest unibrow in Buford County.
You know, all these years l've wondered what would have happened if l'd stayed with my music.
Would l have a little bit more of this? Maybe just a little bit less of this? Well, now with the help of Hannie Montanie, l'm gonna know for sure.
''Uncle who showed up at the worst time possible,'' say what? l know what you're thinking.
This unc can't bring the funk.
Well, get ready to scream like a girl when you feel the power of Uncle Earl.
Well, what'd you think? -l think l lost a filling.
-Me, too.
-l'll drive you to the dentist.
-Okay.
Be honest.
l can honestly say l've never heard anything like it before.
And l may never hear anything ever again like that, because it was special.
So you'll help me? A talent like yours just screams ''help me,'' Earl.
l knew my kin would be there for me.
There's just one little problem.
You see, l have this concert on Saturday and this major critic is coming, so l'm going to be rehearsing every minute, -so l don't -That's no problem.
That's perfect! What better way for me to learn how to be a rock star than to follow you around? You won't even know l'm there.
Just a little fly on the wall.
Just a little fly on the wall l'm going to be needing a really big fly swatter.
l am a rock star Yeah That was awesome.
That was awesome.
Great job, guys.
l can already hear Barney Bittman saying, ''What a band, what a girl, what a show.
'' All right, now let's kick some butt on Nobody's Perfect and call it a great day.
Let's go.
Everybody makes mistakes Everybody has those days One, two, three, four Everybody makes mistakes Everybody has those days Everybody knows what, what l'm talking about Everybody gets that way Everybody makes mistakes Everybody has those days Everybody Uncle Earl, what are you doing? -Watching your rock star moves.
-Gee, thanks.
Earl! Dang flabbit.
There you are.
Come on, Robby Ray.
l done seen the lighting booth, the sound booth, the dressing room.
l just want to watch one song real close up, please? Now, Earl, that puppy dog face used to work when we were kids, but l'm a man now.
What the heck, Miley? One song won't hurt, will it? Thank you, O Man of Steel.
Okay.
You can watch one song, but, please, just don't get in the way.
l won't.
Fly on the wall.
You won't even know l'm here.
Won't even know l'm here.
Not here.
Look out, Uncle Earl.
Earl, you clumsy dang clodhopper! Sorry, young fellow.
lt's cool.
lt was an accident.
-Are you hurt, son? -l think l broke my hand.
But you can still play, right? No.
But l'm sorry, l mean, it's just so important.
Don't worry, kiddo.
l caused this problem, l'm gonna fix it.
l don't like where this is going.
Hannie Montanie, say howdy to your brand-new guitar player.
Everybody makes mistakes Everybody has them days Are you sure you can't play with your feet? Daddy, what am l going to do? As soon as Barney Bittman sees me on stage with Uncle Earl, he'll rip me worse than Mikayla.
Maybe Earl won't be that bad.
l'm gonna be a rock star! l'm gonna be a rock star! He's doing a jig with a pig.
l'll go talk to him.
Perfect.
Dad will talk to him, he'll understand and everything will be okay.
So, who wants pie? You caved, didn't you? l'm sorry, honey, but he looked at me with that puppy dog face.
l've got a puppy dog face, too.
No, Earl's got you beat.
Fine.
l'll go talk to him.
l can't believe it, Pearl.
Miley's making my dream come true.
l feel like Sanjaya, you know, in the early rounds.
And you know what? Ever since l found out l was in the band, l'm not hungry all the time.
lt's like l was eating to fill the emptiness, and now my guts are filled with love.
And it's all because of Miley.
So how did it go? He said l filled his guts with love.
Well, this is quite the dilemma.
You can't keep Uncle Earl away from the critic, and you still haven't figured out how to keep the critic away from Uncle Earl.
What to do, what to do? What's it going to cost me? A hundred bucks and Cuddles sleeps in your room.
-Fine.
-And you clean the tinkle box.
Yours or the pig's? Don't push it.
Now all you have to do is get Barney to leave the concert to go to a party at Ozzy Osbourne's.
Perfect plan lf l knew Ozzy Osbourne! Well, you do now, love.
Sharon! Hannah, this place is packed, and l can see Barney Bittman in the balcony.
Does he look happy? Catch of the day? What day? Last Thursday? Not really.
Miley, the show's going to start in five minutes! Where's Uncle Earl? Maybe he got stage fright! You know, deep down, he really is very shy.
Check out your funky uncle! l'm a rock star! Okay, Funkle Earl, l love the whole flaming head thing you got going on.
Just, can we bring it down a notch? Or more? A lot? Whatever you're comfortable with.
A lot would be good.
Sorry, it's hard to take it down on the greatest night of my life! l mean, look at me! l'm so excited l'm sweating my flames off! Well, then let's go get you a towel.
And maybe a big hat.
Or whatever you're comfortable with.
A big hat would be good.
Well, l guess it's all up to Jackson now.
Pray with me.
Barney! -Barney, you cheeky monkey.
-Ozzy! Come give Ozzy some love.
Ozzy! You look terrible.
What are you doing at a Hannah Montana concert? ls that where l am? l thought l was getting a taco.
Listen.
Listen.
Listen.
l'm listening! -Well? -You didn't say anything.
Right.
There's a party at my house.
Come on! Wait a minute, l have to review Hannah Montana.
But Sharon's making Avocados all mashed together.
lt's very good.
Okay, l'll go with you, but just one question.
How stupid do you think l am? l was hoping, a lot.
Enjoy the show! -Jackson's plan is gonna work.
-Jackson's plan is gonna work.
-Jackson's plan is gonna work.
-Jackson's plan is gonna work.
Great news.
My plan worked.
-lt did? -lt did? Yep.
Bittman's on his way to Ozzy's right now, so just go out there, have a great concert and don't worry about a thing.
-You're lying.
-How did you know? Your lips are moving.
l'm sorry.
l tried.
Y'all saw what Barney Bittman did to Mikayla.
Think about what's going to happen to me when he sees me on stage with the Earl of Embarrassment? l'm an embarrassment to you? -My tooth! -Mine, too.
lt hurts.
-Okay.
Be right back.
-Nice flames.
Uncle Earl, l Earl, l found you a hat.
lt's a big one, too.
You don't want me to play with you, do you? Oh, boy.
No, l don't.
Earl, this is my fault.
l should've been honest with you from the get-go.
We love you, it's just lt's just this show, it's so important and -And you're so -Stupid.
Come on now, Earl.
l mean, you don't have to What was l thinking, trying to be a rock star? l was born a loser.
l'm always going to be a loser.
l'm the most embarrassing dang doofus in this whole family.
Worst than Unlucky Bucky, or Wacky Wilbur, or even Jackson.
Hey.
Good grief, boy, look what you're wearing.
And now, the legendary Tower of Blues is proud to present Hannah Montana! Uncle Earl That's all right.
Robby can play the guitar parts.
He's got the hair for it.
l'm sorry, Earl.
Come on, darling, it's show time.
Oh, yeah How you doing, Tower of Blues? Are you ready to rock? Keep playing, Daddy.
l'll be right back.
Come on, guitar man.
Drop your snack, you're in the act.
What? Yeah, come on.
l need my funky uncky on stage.
l thought you was worried about that big-time critic.
l was, but l was wrong.
The truth is, l don't care what anybody thinks.
Everyone deserves a chance to live their dream, and yours is waiting for you on that stage.
So, come on, l don't have time to argue.
Wait for me! Now we're ready to rock! Sometimes l walk a little faster in the school hallway Just to get next to you Some days, l spend a little extra time in the morning just to impress you Guess you don't notice Guess you don't need this Sad you're not seeing what you're missing On the outside, shying away On the inside, dying to say l'm unusual Not so typical Way too smart to be waiting around Tai chi practising Snowboard champion l can fix the flat on your car l might even be a rock star l might even be a rock star Hit it, Uncle Earl! Can't sleep? How'd you know l was out here? This is where l came after my first concert.
Pretty pumped, aren't you? Kiddo, l haven't been this excited since the last time l saw my belt buckle.
You were awesome tonight.
Thank you.
l can't believe you were foolish enough to let this old hillbilly out on stage.
Hey, if you can't be a fool for family, who can you be a fool for? So what are you going to do now? l'm going to go home.
l miss my Pearl.
But what about your rock star dream? l lived it tonight, thanks to you.
And sitting here, l've realised something very, very important.
What's that? l can't get up.
-How about l help you up? -All right.
What's next? Oh, yeah.
Hannah Montana.
First of all, the name.
lt rhymes.
cute, but why? This is not starting off well.
Why don't l just change the channel? l think Are You Dumber Than A Dog? is on.
Yeah! lt'll be much more fun watching Oliver lose to the beagle again.
That dog was coached! Guys, it's cool.
l did right by my family, and that's all that matters.
Hannah and her band gave one of the most bizarre, chaotic performances l've ever experienced.
Don't care, don't care, don't care.
And l loved every minute of it.
lt was pure old school, kick-butt rock and roll.
The way it should be.
Yes! ln your face, Mikayla! He likes me Barney Bittman likes me Not that l care.

come on, everybody.
Put your hands together.
l want to hear y'all scream! l'm gonna put on my old blue jeans Gonna walk out of here into the street Would you put up resistance? Would it make a difference? Would you know the real me? Me in my old blue jeans Thank you! Thank you! -Where are we? -Albuquerque.
Albuquerque! My favourite city in my favourite state -Guam.
-Guam! l hate you.
l love you all! Good night! Toodles! Get us out of here, Larry! One of the things l love about this bus, it brushes for you.
But it could use a bigger sink.
Hey, Lilly.
Yeah, we just left the show in Albuquerque.
Yes, in New Mexico! Where else would it be? Guam? What? Shut up! No, you shut up.
Oh, my gosh.
Dad, Lilly's got extra tickets to Maroon 5 tomorrow night! We got to get home! Oh, no, but l was kind of hoping we could take the scenic route.
Maybe stop and see a couple historical -Come on.
-Come on, Daddy.
Not another rock where Lewis and Clark took a tinkle break.
When l said they were marking their territory, l meant surveying.
Dad, call it whatever you want.
lt's boring.
Can we please just go home? Yeah.
Please, please, please, please.
Help me out, Lilly.
-Please, please, please, please! -Please, please, please, please! Twenty-one hours of that, Daddy, in Lilly-Miley Surround Sound.
What do you want to do, Miley? Just race your way through life, never taking time to stop along the way and smell the roses? Maybe miss some wonderful surprise that's right in front of you that could change you forever? Yep, that's pretty much the plan.
Lilly, save me a ticket.
l'm on my way home.
Lilly, l gotta go.
Apparently, dessert's on me tonight.
Hey, Larry, back up.
She missed a spot! That's all right, Larry.
l got it.
Son, you might wanna go easy on the makeup.
We're not in Los Angeles yet.
Then why are we stopping? Because we're at a historical landmark.
Look, it's raining outside, l'm hungry, and besides that, this diner comes with one heck of a good story.
And you made me drive right past the world's largest rubber band ball.
You owe me.
Fine.
l know where you can see the world's biggest pile of dirty socks.
Jackson's room! Let's drive! And if you're good, l'll let you ride down the underwear mountain.
Now, l don't want to hear it.
We're gonna stop and smell the dang roses, and you're gonna like it! So clean up your faces, get off this bus and start sniffing! Daddy.
come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds Relax, we won't be here more than a half hour, tops.
Dad, it's gonna take her a half hour just to get here.
Excuse me.
We're ready to order.
Forgot my pen.
Back in a jiff.
You just can't find an old-fashioned hamburger like this out on the main highway.
lt makes you want to savour every bite.
Yeah, sure.
Eating.
Savouring.
Done.
Let's go.
Come on, Miley.
Slow down.
Even your brother's getting into the spirit of this place.
Prospector Pete found his way through the maze to the gold.
Again! Now, about that story.
Twenty years ago, l walked into this very place and had an experience that changed my life.
Let me guess, Daddy, you saw your first mullet and knew that was the do for you.
What a great story.
l'm welling up.
Let's go.
You know what? lf you don't want to hear the story, then l'm not gonna tell it.
You showed us.
Let's go.
Okay, if you two are in such a dang-fired hurry, then just go out on the bus and wait.
l'm gonna sit here and enjoy my delicious burger and think of the memories of a wonderful story that you two will never know.
Excuse me, ma'am.
May l have another cup of your delicious coffee? You're in luck.
l'm brewing a fresh pot.
One, two Time for my break.
Three, four l hope you're happy.
l am.
Hey, Oliver, here's your ticket for Maroon 5 tonight.
Where's my 50 bucks? You'll get it.
Right after Rico pays me for fixing these chairs.
The little genius was gonna pay a professional 1 00 bucks.
l did it for half, and all it took was, like, five minutes and some monster glue.
Who's the genius now? Looks like it's still Rico.
Would you just give me a hand? l always wanted to do that.
Now, would you just help me out of this thing? You fixed this one too, didn't you? lt's solid, isn't it? -Come here.
-No.
Come here.
No, l'm not gonna hurt you.
That's what you always say before you hurt me.
Get over here! Oliver! Okay, this part, this was not my fault.
That's okay.
What's right in front of you right now? -A post.
-Good.
No! He said half an hour, and he's still not back.
This can only mean one thing.
That meringue-loving hillbilly ordered a second piece of pie! l am not going to miss Maroon 5! Come on, Jackson.
Let's go.
You go.
l'm about ready to break my downhill record.
You're about to break something, all right.
No.
No.
Wait.
lt's too fast.
No, no, no.
lt's too fast.
lt's too fast! Awesome! l gotta do that again.
Sorry, buddy, slopes are closed.
Let's go.
And this time, l'm taking off the gloves.
Daddy, l want to go home.
Yep, that ought to get her done.
Let's go.
Miley! Miley.
Miley, are you okay? Next time, you're going first.
That's weird.
What happened to the storm? What happened to this place? All righty, hot stuff coming through.
And l'm not talking about the food, sweet-cakes.
What happened to her? Where's Daddy? l don't know.
Let's ask Mom.
Shake your tail feathers, college girl, you've got tables! Whatever, Loretta.
Come on, there is no way that's Mom.
That's just a girl who looks exactly like Mom when she was in college.
l don't know the exact year.
l do.
1 98 7.
June 2, to be exact.
Brother in a time warp say what? The lightning! lt must have zapped us back in time somehow! That's crazy, and l am going to prove it to you.
Excuse me, ma'am, l'm taking a little survey.
lf you had a daughter, what would you name her? -Miley.
-Thank you.
-We're in trouble.
-Yeah.
Wow.
-Wow, look at her.
-l know.
She's beautiful.
Our mom was totally hot.
And our dad was totally not.
Quick, hide! Jackson, hello, no reason to hide.
We're not born yet.
Right.
Force of habit.
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Sorry, hon, right back.
Oh, man.
Oh, my gosh.
Jackson, this is the story he wanted to tell us! The thing that changed his life.
lt was Mom! We're actually going to see the moment they met! Excuse me, miss? l'm, like, totally lost and kind of in a hurry.
Which way back to Highway 1 0? Egyptian Left at the traffic light.
Can't miss it, hunky boy.
Wicked cool, foxy momma.
Wait, where's he going? Okay, okay, look, don't panic.
He's got to come back, right? l mean, obviously they met, or we wouldn't even be here.
Jackson.
Okay, now we can panic.
-Coffee? -Yeah.
Non-fat vanilla decaf half-caf cap with just a dollop of foam.
Coffee? Yes, please.
-There you go.
-Thank you.
No, don't, don't, don't.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
-Dad's not going anywhere for a while.
-How do you know? While he was on the pay phone, l pulled that out of his car.
l don't know what it is Somebody stole my distributor cap! but l'm guessing it's a distributor cap.
Frost my applesauce.
l still got two days of driving to get back to Nashville, and now l gotta sit here and waste time waiting on a mechanic.
Are you okay? Did anything else disappear? Well, let's just put it this way.
lf l want to drink my coffee, l have to do it like this.
Why isn't anything happening to you? l don't know.
You're the oldest.
First in, first out.
Well, then, we've got to get them together before l totally disappear.
Jackson, relax.
They're only a few feet away.
Could l get some coffee, please? Here it comes.
Sure thing, sugar.
And there it goes.
l am out of here in like 20 minutes, and then we can totally hit that party.
Awesome! How are they going to fall in love? They won't even look at each other.
Jackson, that's it! Any time Dad talks about meeting Mom, he always says that they fell in love the minute they looked into each other's eyes.
So all we've got to do is get them to slow down and take the time to look at each other.
Oh, boy! What? ls there a draught in here? l was right.
There is no brain in there.
You are so lucky l'm watering their plants.
Oh, yeah.
That's me.
Mr Lucky.
Now, can we just get the nail polish remover and pray it works? l really don't want to face the guy at the hardware store who told me to be careful with the monster glue.
Okay, nail polish remover is in Miley's bathroom.
-Why do you get to be in the front? -'Cause l'm a girl, and you, me and the guy at the hardware store agree that you're an idiot.
-Okay, careful on the stairs.
-Okay.
All right.
Steady.
Steady.
What, you're not gonna say ''bless you''? -l'm not feeling it.
-Okay.
So, l would like eggs, a glass of orange juice, you to look lovingly into that man's eyes and a side of bacon.
Listen, kid, l am 20 minutes away from a radical party, so don't harsh my mood with your 'tude.
Now, where's your momma? Closer than you think.
Hey, dude.
Love the mullet.
Hey, dude.
Go away.
Did you check out that waitress? She's a babe! And l'm pretty sure she's single! Listen, kid, l'm kind of working here.
''Don't break my heart, my itchy twitchy heart.
'' No.
''My herky jerky heart.
'' You might want to try ''achy breaky''.
And you might want to try shopping at a men's store.
Achy breaky? That's the dumbest thing l've ever heard.
Let's get a woman's opinion.
Hey, Mom ma mia! Mamma mia, she's a cute girl.
Oh, waitress! Cool your jets.
l'm coming.
Where are you going, Dad dio? Daddy-O.
Anywhere that you aren't.
But she's here! Sweet niblets.
Sweet niblets it is.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
What happened? My butt's gone.
Here.
Get up.
Just get them together.
Hurry! Fine.
Well, here are your eggs.
Scrambled.
Kind of like you.
This seat's too hard.
Too soft.
Too high.
Too low.
-Too lumpy.
-Too bad.
Now, park it, froggy.
l don't have time for this.
l work off tips.
Great, then l've got one for you.
How about this guy? Business in the front, party in the back! You got to love that! Didn't your daddy ever tell you not to talk to strangers? -Not yet! -Well, he should.
First, scarf boy, now you.
l've had about enough of this.
l wish you both would just disappear.
Honey, we're getting there.
Achy breaky heart.
No.
Now, you eat your eggs, and don't you even think about skipping out.
l've got my eyes on you.
Speaking of eyes, why don't we go look at mullet man's? l bet they're gorgeous.
Come on, it'll be fun! l'm game.
How's my hair? Sweet niblets.
Heck, those are popular today.
Hey, Mel, crack open another can of niblets! Come on, Jackson, we've gotta get them back together.
You're usually good at this.
Sorry, but l'm only half the man l used to be.
Make that a quarter.
An eighth.
A sixteenth.
-Jackson? -Bye.
Jackson? l'll miss you, little buddy.
Somebody call for a tow truck? lt's about time.
No, wait, don't go! What? Well, Loretta, that was my last customer.
Toodles.
No! Stop! What in the world? Somebody help me! Not you! Are you okay, sweet pea? -You know, she does look a little pale.
-l'll go call a doctor.
No, stop! You can't leave me.
l guess l was just moving so fast l forgot to see what was right in front of me.
-What? -What? Right in front of me.
Right in front of me! My, oh, my, she was right about your eyes.
ls that a Tennessee accent l hear? Sure enough.
Finally.
Miley.
Miley, are you okay? Jackson! You're okay.
Me? You're the one who almost just got hit by lightning.
Really? Wow.
Look, l'm going to get Dad.
Let's get out of here.
Wait, wait, wait.
What's your hurry? l want to hear that story Daddy was going to tell us.
l have a feeling it's a good one.
l looked into her eyes, heard that cute Tennessee accent, and l knew right then she was the one.
-Daddy.
-Yeah.
We sat in this very booth right here and talked all night.
You know how l knew she loved me? -She laughed at all your jokes? -Every one.
Then again, maybe she was just laughing at my mullet.
Did l mention l hate you? Thirty-seven times.
lf l miss that Maroon 5 concert, l swear You're not gonna miss it.
Miley said she'd be back.
She'll probably be home any minute.
We're not here.
Leave a message.
Lilly, are you there watering the plants? l tried your cell phone a bunch of times.
Hey, l'm sorry, but l'm not gonna make the concert.
We decided to make a few stops along the way.
l got a picture of the world's largest rubber band ball.
That sucker is huge! Have a great time at the concert.
Bye.
l hate you.
Thirty-eight.

Why aren't there any eggs on my fork? Grow up.
You got two hands, make your own breakfast.
Why are you so cranky? Because nobody made my breakfast.
But it's Saturday.
Daddy always makes my eggs.
l hope he's not sick.
Hey, Daddy, are you feeling okay? l'm fine.
Well, then, get to cooking, good-looking.
My eggs ain't gonna scramble themselves.
No, they're not.
Now, if you'll excuse me, l got some jogging to do.
l'd hate to be your scratching post, Mr Sour Puss N' Boots.
What's the matter? Your blow-dryer's on the fritz? Oh, no.
l know what it is, Daddy.
You had a dream that l was the only child and you woke up to that.
No, sadly, l woke up to both of you.
Wow.
He really is upset.
-What did you do? -What did you do? -Me? Yes, you! -Me? Yes, you! -Stop that! -Stop that! come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds Hey, where are my eggs? Right.
Enjoy.
Miles, that's what l love about you.
You're not just pretty.
You're pretty and funny.
Thanks, Jackson.
You know, maybe l will make you some eggs.
Wait, that would make me pretty, funny and stupid.
Well, you left out selfish, which now that l think about it, is probably why Dad's in such a bad mood.
What are you talking about? l'm talking about the way you acted last night before you went to your stupid party.
Remember? You are gorgeous.
The only problem with being me is that everybody else gets to look at me all the time, and l only get glimpses.
-Excuse me, sister dear.
-What? Could l just use a small corner of the mirror? l'd like to try to look good, so that way l don't offend you.
Try putting a paper bag over your head, Ug-face.
Did you miss me? l missed you.
Yes, l did.
You're so pretty.
Miley Stewart, if you'd stop worshipping your reflection, you might just realise that other people live in this house besides you and that big, fat head of yours.
You mean big, fat, gorgeous head.
Okay, so which one of you bozos are driving this teen pop sensation to another glamorous Hollywood party that l'm too shallow to realise is totally pointless? So you're really going out? Tonight? No, l put this outfit on to stare at you eating that cupcake.
Hello, somebody turn the lights on in there.
Father, even though it will make me late for my date, l'll be happy to drive her.
You do so much.
lt would be a privilege to ease your burden in any way that l can.
Jackson, you are an angel sent from heaven above.
Please, let me share my cupcake with you.
Perhaps just a nibble.
lf you two ladies are done with your little wimp-fest, people are waiting to drool over me.
Come on.
Let's go, chop-chop.
-Unbelievable! -l know, Dad.
l know.
Okay, that is so not what happened.
You are the one who acted like a jerk before you went on your stupid date last night.
What are you talking about? l'm talking about the way it really happened.
Remember? Why did l ever agree to attend this frivolous affair? l mean, after all, Father, the most valuable thing we have is time.
Perhaps l should spend mine bettering myself through study.
So young, so wise.
You are my favourite child.
Out of the way, fish face.
ls that Brad Pitt? No, wait, it's me.
Stewart.
Jackson Stewart.
Double-Oh-My, licence to thrill.
So, you're really going out? Tonight? No, l got all handsomed up to watch Tv with you until you doze off and drown out the Hee Haw reruns with your nose whistle.
Jackson, please don't make fun of our father like that, for someday, he will be gone and we will miss him terribly.
Don't worry, Father.
l'll always love you enough for the both of us.
Miley, you are an angel sent from heaven above.
Unlike your brother, who comes from the opposite direction.
Now, Son, l want you to take your sister No, no, no, no! l'm sick of driving her everywhere.
You do it.
lt'll fill that empty void you call your life.
Please, drive me just this once? You don't even have to stop.
Just slow down, and l'll tuck and roll.
Fine! Unbelievable! l know, Daddy.
l know.
And that is obviously why Dad is in such a bad mood.
Wow.
Miley World sounds fun! How do you get to school, on a unicorn? Fine.
We'll just wait for Dad to get back from his jog and we'll ask him.
Yeah, we will.
And then, we'll find out that l'm the one that has the perfect memory.
Really? Do you remember when you put in that waffle? l paid for half of those.
See, this is why you don't get dates.
l'm a girl.
Be nice.
And this is why you don't get dates.
You eat like a pig.
You take that back! And you take this back.
Fine.
Look, your half, my half.
-Fine.
-Fine.
Hey, Mr Stewart.
What's up? Never have kids.
They'll only break your heart.
Now l know why he doesn't get dates.
Yeah, my mom went there once.
Never going back.
-Wait! Don't eat that chip! -Why? lt was on my side.
No, no, no, look! lt's a barbecue-flavoured Darth vader! This is incredible.
Dudes! Dudes! This is cooler than when my alphabet soup spelled ''yixagirple-dink.
'' l'll give you five bucks for it.
-l'll give you six.
-Seven.
Okay, Dad is coming back from his jog.
Get ready to eat your words! That's right, buddy boy.
ln five seconds, Dad is going to tell you Me.
And you can take that to the bank.
-Go ahead, apologise.
-Me? You apologise.
Fine.
Daddy, l'm sorry that Jackson was such a jerk about driving me last night! And l'm sorry that your daughter is a mirror-hogging, ride-mooching, bottomless pit of ''me, me, me, me, me.
'' This isn't about mirrors or rides.
You know what? l shouldn't have to explain it to either one of you.
Figure it out for yourselves.
Then what really did happen last night? Hold on! lf it wasn't how you acted And it's not how you acted And he ain't gonna tell us anything.
Well, then what was it? The mail! -l bet it was your report card.
-l bet it was your phone bill.
lt was not my Well, it's possible.
lt's just nothing but a bunch of birthday cards.
-For Dad.
-On his 40th.
Which was yesterday.
-l can't believe you forgot! -l can't believe you forgot! -Me? Yes, you! -Me? Yes, you! -Stop that! -Stop that! Okay, so we forgot his birthday.
We're probably not the only ones.
Mamaw, Uncle Earl and Aunt Pearl, Roxy, Aunt Dolly.
Even Bucky's BBQ sent him a coupon for a free mud pie.
He's 40 now, he doesn't need that.
Jackson, this is serious.
We forgot one of the biggest birthdays of his life.
Now all we can do is apologise.
Nothing we can do? Miley, Miley, Miley.
Have l taught you nothing? Now close your eyes, find your centre, and try to put yourself into my brain.
-Now you see what l see.
-This is perfect.
We plan a surprise party and make Dad think we never forgot.
Wow, that's way better than my idea of stealing his coin jar and running away to Mexico.
Miley, you need to get down here, or you're gonna be late for the big CD signing.
You know, maybe 40 minutes late.
The big 4-0.
Nothing.
Hey.
l got the decorations.
Great.
The cake will be here in an hour.
Let me see.
Happy Fifth Birthday? Well, they were all out of ''Happy 40th's,'' so l got four ''fives'' and two ''tens.
'' Hey, adding is good for old people.
lt keeps the mind agile.
Coming! Here's Dad's PDA.
Try to get as many of his friends to come as you can.
Leave it all to me.
Sadly, l have no choice.
Hey, Mr Adams, it's Jackson.
We're throwing a surprise party for Dad.
Tonight.
No, we didn't forget.
Tonight.
No, we didn't forget.
Okay, so we forgot! Your Christmas lights are still up.
Who are you to judge? So are you coming? Hello? Hello? Look, l don't care if your wife is in labour.
Just tell her to pop that sucker out and get over here! Hello? l got 50, 50.
Who'll take Darth home for 60? $60 for this one of a kind, deep-fried sci-fi icon.
-Who'll give us 70? 70? -l'll give you 1 00.
l think the chip's alive.
l was on my way to scuba lessons when l heard the sound of money being made without me.
Unacceptable.
Yo, back off, Rico.
Okay? This has nothing to do with you.
Where'd you get the chip? -ln a bag we bought from the shack.
-Yeah.
Do you have the receipt? l keep every receipt.
My dad's an accountant.
An accountant.
Well, the ''accountant'' probably should have taught you how to read the fine print.
Read it and weep.
''All food items resembling real or fictional characters ''andlor historical landmarks ''are the exclusive property of Rico lndustries, ''a subsidiary of Mwah Ha Ha lnternational.
'' -Hand it over.
-Or we could run.
-Yeah, l like that idea.
-Okay.
There you go.
Sorry the line was so long.
Hey.
''Lose 40 Pounds in 40 Days.
'' And it's 40% off.
You think l should buy it for somebody? You know, as a present? Nothing.
There you go.
Hey! l just got to make a quick phone call.
Hey, Jackson.
How are we doing? l need more time.
Stall him.
-How am l going to -Just do it! -But -l said do it, diva! Hi.
What's your name, sweetie? Ed.
Really? What a great name.
How do you spell that? -E-D.
-lnteresting.
ls that short for something, like Edward, or Edwin, Eduardo? lt's just Ed.
Would you sign it, please? We've been waiting for hours.
Okay.
You and me both, sister.
''Dear Ed, life's what you make it, ''so let's make it rock.
''Life's what you make it, -''so come on'' -Come on.
-''come on'' -Come on.
-''come on.
'' -Come on! Okay.
''Love, Hannah Montana.
'' Hey, Dad! Can you get my purse? l left it in the backseat of the car! Sure.
What's another 40 seconds of my useless life? Okay.
Jackson! l'm on the front porch.
Dad's going to be here any minute.
Are you doing okay? When you say, ''Okay'' Oh, boy.
Hi! Why am l staring at a bunch of total strangers? They're not total strangers.
This is Jerry, the mailman.
Georgie, the gas metre checker lady gal.
Louie delivered the cake, and Frank's from the balloon store.
Thanks for inviting me.
Twenty years of blowing up balloons.
Okay.
And who are they? l found them at the beach.
They call themselves ''The Aristocrats.
'' Hit it, kids! This is the best you could do? As soon as Dad sees this, he's gonna -Surprise! -Surprise! look like that.
Happy birthday, Bobby! lt's ''Robby.
'' Happy birthday, Robby! Didn't see that one coming, did you, Daddy? And you thought we forgot.
Thanks for coming, everybody! Thanks.
Y'all are fantastic! You rock, Robby Ray! Next year, 41 ! You're all invited! Don't forget! Wow, what a party.
Good times, good times.
Yeah.
Happy birthday, big guy! Hold it, you two.
Okay.
We forgot your birthday.
And when we tried to get people, it was all, ''l'm out of town,'' or ''l'm in jail,'' or ''l'm giving birth.
'' We're sorry, Daddy.
We're selfish, horrible kids who don't deserve a dad as wonderful as you.
Let's not oversell it.
No, she's right, l am a wonderful dad.
And when you forgot my birthday, well, it just kind of made me feel like you didn't appreciate me.
But we do appreciate you, Daddy.
You got to believe that.
Actually, after the party y'all put together this evening, l do believe you.
Because it takes a lot of effort to put together a train wreck like this.
We really do love you, Dad.
l know.
Maybe next year, you could just love me on time.
Come on, l'm a man.
Men don't hug.
-Stewart men do.
-Yeah, we do.
So, what'd you guys get me? Free mud pie from Bucky's BBQ! lt's from both of us.

l still can't believe Hannah's getting her own diamond on the Hollywood Parade of Diamonds.
Come on, Oliver.
l know it's a big honour, but let's not act like tourists.
Just be cool.
Oh, my gosh, it's Madonna! -Take our picture.
-Take our picture.
-Take our picture.
-Take our picture.
Yeah.
That's really cool.
What is it with chicks and Madonna? l love you.
So, where's your diamond gonna be? Well, the Hollywood Diamond Committee said it's two past Madonna.
So, Madonna, Brad Pitt What's that gunk on your diamond? lt looks like chilli.
lt is chilli.
And it's gross.
Come on, people, keep it in your buns.
Excuse me.
Could you move your cart down the street a little? Could l? Sure.
Will l? No.
But you could put it right by Scooby-Doo's diamond.
''Hot dog on a hot dog.
'' l'll help you push.
Hands off the cart, princess.
l've been slinging weenies on this spot for 20 years, and l'll be slinging them for 20 more.
But Hannah Montana's diamond is gonna be here, and your dogs are leaking on it.
Hannah Montana? All the kids in my building love her.
-So you'll move? -No.
l hate all the kids in my building.
Give it up, cupcake.
There's nothing in the world that's going to get me off of this spot.
Quitting time.
Don't worry, folks.
l'll be back tomorrow.
My bad.
l am not cleaning that up, mister.
-Oliver, clean it up.
-No.
Hey, look, flowers.
At night, devoted fans can place rose petals on your diamond to cover up the chilli stink.
Still disgusting, but better.
-Are you all right? -Fine.
The flowers make me phlegmy.
Right on the diamond.
Let me guess.
You've been here And after that, my son'll take over.
Wow, talk about your spitting image.
come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds lt was disgusting.
There was so much gunk on the sidewalk, it was like l was getting my diamond on Uncle Earl's back porch.
Come on, darling.
l'm eating here.
Besides, it's not important where they put the diamond, it's the fact they gave you one in the first place.
But the place they gave me is on the corner of Chilli Avenue and Snot Rocket Boulevard.
Now let me tell you, when they gave me my diamond, what they did was Put it right in front of the world famous Chinese Theatre, right where the tour bus lets off.
They say it's one of the most photographed diamonds out there, but l may not be the best example.
You think? Let me tell you, honey, what's important, is always remember, it's just an honour to have one.
All right, great.
Then you'll give me yours.
Honey, that wouldn't be right.
Then you would have a great spot and learn nothing.
What kind of a father would l be if l let that happen? The kind that just wants to keep his spot.
Honey, l had it first.
Besides that, it's right next to John Wayne.
The Duke, honey, the Duke.
But you said location doesn't matter.
lt doesn't.
l'm just too old to listen to myself.
You, on the other hand, legally have to.
Bye-bye.
No.
Please just be a little broken.
Please just be a little broken.
l said please! And l was gonna get you a hot wax! Hey-o, it's Rico! Rico, my car broke down.
l'm going to be late for work.
Sure, these things happen.
l totally understand.
Well, gee, thanks, man.
Of course, if you're not here in five minutes, you're fired.
Come on.
Have a heart.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What if l get somebody to cover my shift? ls it somebody like you or someone with a brain? That's a good one, boss.
Hey, wanna hear another good one? 3, 2 Hey, boss.
What do you want me to do first? A jumbo Jackson.
This is gonna be good.
Excuse me.
l am looking for a Mr Randall Garrison, the President of the Parade of Diamonds Committee.
You found him.
-What? -l don't know! You screamed first! l'm just so thrilled to finally meet Hannah Montana.
What can l do for you? Whatever it is, the answer is yes.
-Great.
Move my diamond.
-No.
-But you said the answer is yes.
-l lied.
But, Mr Garrison, you don't understand.
There's this hot dog guy with drippy chilli and this phlegmy flower family goingall over my diamond, and now all over your shoe.
Sorry? So am l.
Look, rules are rules.
Only once in our history have we ever moved a diamond.
-Whose diamond? -Your diamond.
My diamond? Originally, you were in a wonderful spot, then l switched it.
Special request from a great talent and an even greater humanitarian.
That's right.
l'm talking about Pancake Buffalo.
A puppet? l lost my diamond to a pile of purple felt with a hand where its heinie should be? Hold it right there.
When l was a little boy, and Tv was my only friend, that pile of purple felt taught me how to love.
v ery, very touching.
Switch me back.
And put my little buffalo back under that horrible pile of chilli and lung lava? l don't think so.
Fine.
lf you won't do the right thing, then l'll just go talk to the hand.
What hand? The hand that's up to its elbow in buffalo butt.
Here you go.
Enjoy.
Y'all come back now, you hear? Excuse me, Mr Stewart.
Anyone ever told you you've got great hair? Rico, is the sky blue? l wouldn't know.
l'm not looking at the sky.
l'm looking at hairy nachos! A friend of yours, l presume? l guess l could wear a hat.
Thanks, but l've got a better idea.
There.
This is a crime against nature.
Fine.
You can lose the hair net, but Jackson will lose his job.
You are an evil little boy.
Flattery will get you nowhere.
Now l believe it's time to scrape the gum from underneath the counter.
This may take some time.
l chew a lot of gum.
Hey, cafeteria lady, less looky, more scrapey.
You are about to find yourself in a very sticky situation.
Hey, Rico, l got my car started.
Rico? -My dad? -Yeah.
-l'm fired? -Yeah.
And that's all the planets in our solar system We'll sing it again tomorrow in case you missed them l'm Astronaut Hector.
And l'm Pancake Buffalo And that is the end of our out of this world Outer space, intergalactic show Bye-bye, kids.
That was a wonderful rehearsal.
Hector, you deserve an extra-special cupcake.
Eight years of drama school for this.
l can't believe l'm this close to Pancake Buffalo.
That little puppet taught me how to go potty.
Diapers are for babies l'm a big kid don't you know And when l get that uh-oh feeling l know where to go The potty, the potty And flush it all down l get it! l get it.
You got the ''potty'' in you.
Excuse me, Miss Pancake Buffalo puppet-person lady.
Hi, l'm Cindy Merriwether, and l know who you are, Hannah Montana.
But l don't know who you are, or you, either.
But that's okay, because When you don't know someone's name lt's Mike and Lola! Anyway, l hear that Pancake and l are gonna be neighbours on the Parade of Diamonds.
And Pancake is so excited.
Miss Merriwether? l'm not a kid any more.
You don't have to pretend like Pancake's real.
What do you mean? -That he's a puppet.
-Oh, no, he's not.
Yes, he is.
You operate him behind this thing.
No, l don't.
Pancake is my special friend.
At my high school reunion, he was my date.
lt's nap time, Pancake.
She's just deep into character.
Yeah, scary deep.
Bindenboudenschlasser truffles, made with milk from happy Swiss cows.
-Now what can l do for you? -Well, you see Well, you know that you've kind of Well, you and You stole my diamond! Now, you don't need to use your angry voice.
You know, she's always had a problem with that.
-Zip it! -You see? Hannah, darling.
Cindy understands why you're such a grumpy-umpus.
You had the diamond first, and we shouldn't have switched it without asking.
So you'll switch me back? -l would love to.
-Yes! But it's not up to me.
l don't like where this is going.
lt's up to me, blondie, so ask me with your happy voice.
Cindy, please.
There's no Cindy down here! Now let me hear that happy voice.
Okay.
Pancake Buffalo.
Will you please give me my diamond back? Well, now that you put it that way No! But that's not fair! You want to switch diamonds? Go ask that Garrison bozo.
Wait a minute, he loves me.
Okay, listen here, you glorified oven mitt.
Hey, Hannah, want to know the weather report for Montana? Chilli all day, with 1 00% chance of spit showers! Security! Security! Don't validate her parking.
Excuse me, Mr Garrison.
Miss Montana.
Again.
And if it's about your diamond, l don't want to hear it.
But, Mr Garrison, you don't understand.
l went to Cindy Merriwether and she made me talk to the puppet like it was real.
He is real to millions of children.
So, what did he say? Your fuzzy little friend called you a bozo.
Miss Montana -But it's true.
-We were there.
lf you'll excuse me.
Okay, that's it.
lf Captain Kiss-Up is not gonna believe that Merriwether and her puppet are evil, we will just have to show him.
And how do we do that? Well, it usually involves bad accents, sticky food and dumb costumes.
That is so not true.
Hey, Oliver, can you get your hands on your mom's old security outfit? -l'm so in.
-Rookie.
Keep them sharp.
l like to scratch.
Come on.
We talked about this.
Fine.
Hey, Rico.
There's someone here who wants to talk to you.
l'm all ears.
l'm sorry.
My behaviour was totally inappropriate and a disgrace to this fine establishment.
-l hate this.
-Just do it.
And in no way reflects the opinion of my diligent, hard-working son.
There.
What can l say? l'm as forgiving as l am handsome.
Apology accepted.
Now was that so hard? You really want to rattle the gator's cage, boy? No, sir.
You're a genius.
Okay, so, l guess l'll just go back to work then.
l always wondered why he was such a loser.
Now l know.
He gets it from his dad.
Excuse me? Talk about your country dumbkin.
''Country dumbkin''? Jackson! Say it.
Go on.
Say it.
All right, l'm sorry.
-And? -l have a big mouth.
-l can't hear you.
-l have a big mouth! Now was that so hard? -This isn't funny.
-That's right.
But this is.
Well, we have two hours before the ceremony.
ls there anything you or Pancake need? Randall, thanks to you, we're right as rainbows, and Pancake is so happy you moved his diamond home.
He has a special surprise for you.
Calm down, Randall.
You're an adult.
Hi, Randall.
Hi, Pancake! You've been so wonderful.
l'm making you an honorary Buffalo Buddy.
l've always wanted to be a Buffalo Buddy.
l could never collect enough box tops because my mom always said, ''Your cereal is too sugary.
'' Meanwhile, she was packing away the doughnuts like they were going out of style.
Now, Randall.
l know.
Angry voice.
l'm sorry.
You got a permit for this little party? Of course l do.
lt's in my car.
Hey, hey, hey.
l'll ask the questions around here.
l wasn't asking a question, Officer Nancy Oken? My father named me that.
His name was Harriet.
You got a problem with that? No.
Not if You don't? Just get the permit, sir.
-Proceeding east with suspect.
-Roger, Nancy.
Phase 2 is a go.
l've got Bindenboudenschlasser chocolate for you! Did somebody say Bindenboudenschlasser chocolates? Milk the happy Swiss cows myself.
Wait.
Wait.
Pancake, honey, Mommy'll be back in just a sec.
This permit looks good.
You'd be surprised how many people try to get fancy with the Nancy.
Oliver! lt's your mother.
Stop messing with my walkie-talkie! l gotta go.
Sorry about that.
Miss Merriwether? Pancake? lt's me.
Your Buffalo Buddy.
Get over it, you snivelling little dork.
What? Hey, folks, want to see a genuine Hollywood freak? Check out the middle-aged loser talking to a puppet.
No, l'm not talking to a puppet.
l How can you say that? We're Buffalo Buddies.
Yeah, and it's a big deal.
When you're three! Grow up, or do you want to spend the rest of your life living with your doughnut-scarfing mother? That's enough, Miss Merriwether.
That's enough! No, this is enough.
That's it.
l'm giving Hannah Montana her spot back.
Yes! You've just bought yourself a one-way ticket to loogie land.
Kommen Sie back.
No, those are not real Bindenboudenschlasser chocolates! Yeah, they are.
Miss Merriwether? Pancake? Guys.
Sorry.
But these things are so good.
Great.
Even my friends splat on my diamond.
l wish l wouldn't have even gotten this stupid thing.
Mommy! Mommy! lt's Hannah Montana's diamond.
Take my picture.
Looks like she thinks it's pretty cool.
You know, if your fans don't care where your diamond is Then l shouldn't either? l guess that is what it really is all about.
Pretty much.
l cannot believe how nuts l went trying to get my spot back.
That's it.
Set her down easy, right on top of old Pancake Buffalo.
Hey, look at that.
A gift from above.
l'll be right back.
l gotta go leave a little something for Pancake.
Hey, where do you think you're going, buddy? Well, l gotta No, you don't! Yes, l do.
Then try the gas station four blocks down.
Looks like you could use the exercise.
What am l doing? You're a puppet.
Yeah.
Yeah, a puppet that's about to knock you silly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Be scared.
Anybody else want a piece of me? How about you, grandma? Yeah.
Yeah.

Hey, Rico.
What's going on over here? A wonderful thing.
A wonderful, magical thing.
The mother ship's finally coming back to take you to Planet Shortdork? No.
That generous billionaire over there is donating a new playground.
Finally, the children will have a swing to swing on, a slide to slide on And your hot dogs to spend money on? Papa didn't raise no fool.
Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time to hop into the world of advertising.
Miley.
Miley.
Hello! What? That guy over there.
When l saw him, it was like we were the only two people on this beach.
They say that happens with true love.
What if it turns out that he's the one? At your wedding, l'll be able to say that l was standing right next to you when You completely ignored me and walked away.
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my wife, Jeanette, and myself, William Harris, it's a great honour to present to the city of Malibu this cheque for the new William Harris Playground and Recreation Centre.
Hi.
Hi.
This isn't about me, William Harris.
This is about the children.
About the children, and how happy they will be playing at the William Harris Playground and Recreation Centre, donated by me, William Harris.
Wow, l guess the only thing bigger than that cheque is his big fat head.
Now, l want you to meet my son.
This ought to be good.
-Trey.
-That's me.
Of course it is.
come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds Miley, it's been two days.
You got to forget about him.
l can't.
l let him slip through my fingers like this sand he walked on.
This beautiful, beautiful sand.
Bye-bye sand.
Okay, you talked to him for like a minute.
-You don't even know him.
-So? You're in love with Orlando Bloom, and he doesn't even know you exist.
Yet.
But he will.
And then you will watch the Lilly Bloom.
-Lilly Bloom? -l know! How cool is that? Lilly, l'm serious.
l can't get him out of my head, and now he's gone.
lt's not like Orlando, where you can just push ''play disc'' again.
And, in the shirtless scenes, slo-mo.
lnteresting ring.
-Well, l was homesick.
-Yeah.
-Hello.
-Hannah.
Hey, Traci, now's not really a good time.
Tell me about it.
My Putt-Putt for Puppies charity event is in four hours, and l just found out Abigail Breslin and her partner are wearing blue.
Wow! First, global warming, and now this.
l know! So, fashion flash, Team Traci is now wearing mauve.
-What? -Mauve.
-What? -Purple! Just wear purple! Traci, l don't think l'm going to be able to come tonight.
Hannah, you're my partner.
l can't be partner-less at my own Putt-Putt for Puppies party.
l'll look pathetic.
-Fine, l'll be there.
-All better.
What did she want? To make sure l was wearing mauve.
-What? -Mauve.
-What? -Purple! l don't even want to go.
l just want to sit and dream about Trey.
Hi.
Okay, here's the deal.
You wait here, l'll go back home, send my extremely normal twin sister back.
-l think you're going to like her.
-Really? Right, Lilly? Yeah, it's true.
All the cute, none of the kooky.
One sec.
There.
Now l'm as kooky as you feel.
-l'm Trey.
-l'm Miley.
l'm Lilly.
And l'm leaving.
l'm not actually leaving-leaving.
l just want him to think l'm leaving-leaving, so he doesn't think l'm watching, which l will be, -but he won't know because -Go! You were saying? Listen, l was wondering if you'd go out with me tonight.
-Tonight? -Yeah.
-Tonight's going to be -Perfect.
For you to go out.
Because l, your best friend, will be busy at a charity putt-putt golf tournament filling in for another friend, a blonde one, who sings Too much information.
Thank you.
-So, tonight? -Yes! Sorry, your moment.
What she said.
Cool, l'll have a car come pick you up and you can meet us at the restaurant.
Us? What, are you bringing your parents? Actually, yes.
Melon-headed hottie say what? Ma, you were right.
l should've hired a housekeeper years ago.
This place is cleaner than Uncle Earl the time he chased that rolling quarter through the car wash.
Yeah.
Lord, yeah, she's just about cleaned the entire house.
All she has left to do is Jackson's room.
l gotta go, Ma.
l have never seen anything so disgusting in my whole life.
And l've watched my toothless husband eat corn on the cob.
Now, l know the boy's a little messy, but Messy? l'd say he lived like a pig, but that would be an insult to pigs! l quit! How about if l double your salary? l was bitten by a sock.
Let me at least get the door for you.
Hey! You must be the new cleaning lady.
l'm Jackson.
You must be so very proud.
l don't know what her problem was, Dad.
There's a place for everything and everything's in its place.
Then what is a hot dog doing in your shoe? lt's a foot-long.
Foot.
Shoe.
Get it? l'll tell you what l get.
You're going to clean up this trash heap.
And you can start by picking up these clothes and putting them in the closet where they belong.
No, Dad, l wouldn't do that.
That's it! We're cleaning this room out! And stop tickling my foot, boy! l'm way over here.
Lilly, darling, don't l look smashing? Miley, darling, what are my other choices? Okay, look, l'm meeting Trey's parents! They're like billionaires.
l've got to make sure they like me.
So if that means looking like this and talking funny, then, ''William, Jeanette, it's divine to meet you.
Kiss, kiss.
Kiss, kiss.
'' Hello, ladies.
Miley, what the Sam heck are you doing dressed like that? l'm going on a date.
Wow, if you don't like the guy, why don't you just tell him? Works for me.
-Really? -Yeah.
At least l know the fellow will keep his hands off of you.
See? Lilly, l have never felt this way about a guy before.
l really like him.
And if his parents don't like me, then that could ruin everything.
What am l supposed to do? Okay, he already likes you just the way you are.
l'm sure his parents will too.
Maybe you're right.
l mean, Trey is really awesome, how bad can his parents be? Hey, l'm Miley Stewart.
Nice to meet y'all.
What an adorable little accent.
Son, you never mentioned she's a genuine country bumpkin! l've never met a bumpkin.
Wait till l tell the girls at the club.
You're kidding me, right? Darling, please, don't just stand there.
Have a seat.
Or should l say, ''Sit a spell''? -Okay, listen -We'll be right back.
Trey, take your time.
We'll be ''a-waitin'.
'' -l know, l know, they're a little -Rude? Mean? Horrible? -Why didn't you warn me? -Because you wouldn't have come.
And l wouldn't have been able to do this.
Oh, boy.
Please, don't let them scare you off.
l really like you.
Well, lucky for you, l don't scare easy.
Mr and Mrs Harris? l have something to say.
l am Miley Stewart, and l am not just some regular hillbilly.
Hello.
Hannah, you have to get down here pronto.
Your friend, Lola, is ruining my party.
Hey, Orlando! Great butt.
Putt! Great putt! Wait, come back! This is the most hideous evening anyone could ever have.
Wanna bet? Look at me, darling, l'm country.
Thank you.
Miley.
Refreshing, light, lemony.
They're called finger bowls, dear.
lt's for ''warshing up'' between courses.
-''Warshing up''? -l'm sorry.
Well, if the soup is half as good, this ought to be quite a meal.
lnteresting.
What is it? They They call it sweetbreads.
Doesn't taste like bread.
That's because it's cow pancreas.
And it's yummy.
Trey, l forgot to mention, next week, we're taking the private jet to London for a gala with the Queen.
Perhaps your little friend would like to come.
Have you ever been on a plane, dear? Yes, ma'am, l have.
l'm sorry.
l meant one that doesn't spray crops.
All right, Mother, that's enough.
You're darn tootin' that's enough! Not only have l been on a jet, l have already met the Queen.
ln fact, l sang The Other Side of Me for her and her granddaughter.
-Really? -Really? Really? Who wants dessert? Oh, no, l'd much rather hear about how you sang for the Queen.
Well, it wasn't just me, it was my school.
ln London.
Where l went to school.
ln London.
-Which school? -Hogwarts.
Miley, where are you going with this? l'll tell you when l get there.
Why were you living in London? My daddy worked there as a Diplomat? Okay.
Diplomat! v ery impressive.
We'd love to meet him.
Well, we will most definitely have to do that in the very near or distant future.
No, there's no time like the present, my dear, let's go right now.
-Now? -Now.
Unless you have a problem with that? No! No problem at all.
l've just got to go powder my nose.
v ery shiny.
You know what l mean, girl.
Daddy, my date's parents want to come and meet you.
-Now.
-Now? Yeah, and they're kind of snobby, so if you could, you know, clean up around the house, fluff the pillows, flush the toilets, pick the hair out of the soap, that kind of thing.
Okay.
Well, it's going to take a little more than that.
Dad, one more thing, l kind of almost blew the Hannah secret, so l'm gonna have to ask you one more teeny-tiny little favour.
We're home! Welcome to Stewart Manor! Sweet niblets.
Father, Brother, meet the Harrises.
Please, call me William.
Jolly good! And l'm Jeanette.
Good show! l'm Trey.
-Jolly good show! -Jolly good show! That's odd.
They speak with an English accent and you don't.
Yes.
They do.
And there is a very simple explanation for that.
Right, Father? Of course.
Tell them, Jackson! She had a nanny! From Nashville! Who made her watch reruns of The Beverly Hillbillies.
On the telly! Now that was a jolly good show! Okay, this has been lovely! Thanks for the ride home! Don't be silly, we just arrived.
Let's all get to know each other! Capital idea! You come with me, young thing! -Remember how you said you like me? -Yeah.
-Hold on to that.
-Right.
So there we are, Prince William on my left, Prince Harry on my right, and the fox just in front of us.
Well, l crept right up to that magnificent animal and l said, ''Hey, foxy momma, can l buy you a soda?'' Well, she said yes.
And once again, the two young princes had to admit that l was the king! Really, this is too much.
What kind of fools do you think we are? This is why l don't get second dates.
Can't you see it, Trey? They're fortune hunters! What did you just call us? A bunch of backwoods, banjo-strumming, hillbilly gold-diggers.
Now, listen here, Bub.
And you, too, Mrs Bub.
Dad, let it go.
l made this mess, let me clean it up.
lt's nice knowing you.
l want y'all to get your snooty booties out of our house! Excuse me? No.
l have been excusing you all night, and l'm done with it.
Okay, sure, my daddy's no diplomat, but he's not a banjo-strumming hillbilly either.
He's a guitar-strumming hillbilly, and l'm proud of him! And my brother! Let me just tell you, my brother What are you going to do? Can't pick your family.
Gee, thanks, sis.
l'm feeling the love.
So if y'all can't accept me and where l come from, don't let the door hit you where the good Lord split you.
Bye-bye.
Jolly good show, darlin'.
Jeanette, Trey, we're leaving! You know what? No, no, you're leaving.
l'm staying, if that's all right with you.
-Half an hour? -l'll drive you home.
l just got to go out to the barn and hitch up that there team of mules.
-This is not the way we raised you.
-l'm disappointed in you, son.
The feeling's mutual.
You know the sprinklers just went on out front.
You guys might want to go out the back.
l'd cram myself through a mail slot to get out of this place.
The sprinklers go on in the morning.
Wait for it.
Jeanette, let go of my leg! l'm not touching your leg! Now, that is a jolly good show.
So you actually eat these things with your hands? lt's the only way.
l love this! You know, l think the boy's got promise.
Yeah, you should try grunting.
lt's fun.
-You don't have to do that.
-l'm not gonna.
Oh, no, it's Traci.
l wonder what Lilly did now.
Hello? Orlando! You don't understand.
We're meant for each other! You can't run away from destiny! You so owe me.

-Dahliano, l -Don't speak.
-But l -No, no, no, don't speak.
Now you may speak.
Honey, this outfit deserves more than speaking.
lt deserves the Hannah Happy Dance.
l love my outfit l love my outfit She loves her outfit She loves her outfit l am a genius l am a genius So, where will we be wearing us? The Oscars, the Emmys, the Grammys? The Sunshine Girls.
l'm being honoured as their Role Model of the Year! Why not just take these pins and jam them into my flesh? There'll be a tonne of rich moms asking who l'm wearing.
And that is why, as you can see, you are my favourite pop star.
Dahli! Hello, Dahli! lt's lsis! Move it, pop princess.
The queen has arrived.
lsis! l love her! lmmaterial Girl was my theme song when l was six! She's my idol! l hog-called lmpress Yourself at the Buford County fair and won second prize! What won first? Uncle Earl belching Sweet Home Alabama.
Good story.
But stop talking and help me make this room presentable.
Better.
Hey! Sweetness, you're adorable, but you look like Raggedy Ann threw up all over you.
Darling, l'm here! Oh, my.
lt's you.
lt's me? lt's you! Yes, it is, but it's also you.
l think you're fabulous.
You think l'm fabulous? l think you're fabulous! -Thank you.
-Thank me? Thank you! l grow tired of this.
So, what bit of brilliance is my little Dahli creating for you? This.
What do you think? l love it! -Can we have a moment? -Of course.
Darling, do you mind? l am so glad that you like my outfit.
Darling, l also like seaweed wraps, but l don't wear them in public.
l mean, look at that thing.
lt's so Hannah Montana.
That's because l am Hannah Montana.
You You didn't think l was someone else, did you? You want to know how l survived all these years? Change! Constant change.
New looks, new sound.
You have to know what's next and do it first, because lf you don't change Do a rearrange Everyone will go ''She's boring.
'' -They will? -Yes! lf you want to stay on top, you have to think outside the box.
l always have a next, a next-next, and this morning, during yoga, l got a glimpse of my next-next-next.
And Antonio Banderas with his leg behind his head! Wowza! So, you already have your next-next-next? l don't even know what l'm having for dinner tonight.
ln that case, it was a nice little career.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
l wasn't.
Until now.
You're still here? Hey, Hannah? Dahliano says we have to go.
What do you want to do next? l don't know.
come on! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it's the best of both worlds Hey, how are you? lt's such a nice day, let's go out on the deck and enjoy it.
What do you say? How can l enjoy the day? Look at my outfit.
What are you talking about? lt's classic Hannah Montana.
That's a terrible thing to say! Of course it is.
l hate it.
Help me, Lilly.
Well, l would, but l think l stepped in something.
What? She met lsis today, who told her Hannah's career's in trouble.
Honey, now, why would Hannah's career be in trouble? Because if she doesn't have a next-next, she's going to lose her pants? -Fans! Fans! -Fans! Fans! She thinks if she doesn't change her sound and her look, her fans will get bored.
Darling, that's not going to happen.
l can hear him! You know how much your audience loves you.
Now.
But what about a year from now? lsis has been on top for 20 years because she always mixes it up.
Shoot, honey, l know a lot of pop stars who never mixed it up and they still have great careers today.
Like who? Who wants pie? l'll have pie! l'm so excited about going out with you this weekend, Becky.
You won't be sorry for giving me a second chance.
Or a third chance? You know what? You're cute when you're clumsy.
And you're cute when your nose is bleeding.
Here, let me clean that up for you.
Get out while you can.
He brings everyone down to his level.
Well, l guess l'll see you Saturday night.
And Thursday and Friday night from your bushes.
-Go away! -You go away.
-You go away.
-You go away.
You guys are so funny.
You're like two sisters, but you're boys.
You mean like brothers? Right.
Whatever.
l'm confused.
They say opposites attract, yet you're both stupid.
l'm going to let you get away with that because l'm a nice guy and because l need an advance on my salary for my date.
-Sure.
-Come on! What? As a matter of fact, consider it a gift.
Okay, what's the catch? No catch.
There is, however, a condition.
For the rest of today, every time someone says the word ''dog,'' you have to Hot dog over here.
Can we get seven dogs? Yeah, Rico, l'm barking.
l'm barking all the way to the bank! Hey, tomorrow, maybe l can moo for moola.
Let's just see where barking takes us.
-What do you want, honey? -l'll have a hot dog.
What did you say to her? Nothing.
Just get her the hot dog.
You calling my girlfriend a dog? That's it, you're dog meat! A new sound, that can't be too hard to come up with.
Hey! Hey, what about hip-hop? Dude, that'd be totally cool.
l don't know.
You mean like Half-dolla Hannah? l'm a Half-dolla Hannah You can call me five dimes You can call me anything As long as it rhymes And if you don't like it Well, l don't really care 'cause l'm Half-dolla Hannah And l got facial hair Word 'Fraid not.
Well, what about something a little more retro? You know, like techno-Hannah.
Techno-Hannah? clip it, clip it clip it real good Then chip it, chip it Like Tiger Woods That one could hurt people.
l don't understand.
This seems so easy for lsis.
l mean, she can go from slam rock to glam rock, from punk to funk.
That's why she's the queen of pop, and if l don't do something You'll be the queen of flop? Sorry.
lt was right there.
l will not be the queen of flop.
lf lsis can do a 1 80 every few years, so can l.
Wait a minute.
That's it! Of course that's it! What's it? l just have to be the opposite of Hannah.
The anti-Hannah.
Of course, the anti-Hannah! What's the anti-Hannah? You'll see.
Well, l used to be a nice girl Always doing what l'm told And l'm here to tell you, baby That it's getting kind of old Say goodbye to all the sparkles And all the pretty girly lace l'm gonna chew your little heart up And then l'll spit it in your face So, what do you think of the new Hannah? -l know.
Surprising, isn't it? -Yeah.
-And different, right? -Surprisingly different.
Exactly what l was going for.
A Hannah no one will expect! Or ever wants to see again.
At all.
Maybe.
l'm just guessing.
All right, l know it's a bit edgy for me, but that's what lsis says l've got to do.
Surprise my audience.
Well, honey, let's think about this now.
Surprising them is one thing, but scaring the bejeebees out of them is another.
Hey, Daddy, l hate to say this, but you're not exactly the hip audience l'm trying to reach.
l'll have you know l'm very hip.
Fo'sizzle.
Okay, one, it's fo'shizzle.
Four years ago.
And second, your idea of a big Saturday night is sitting on the couch with your easy-fit jeans unbuttoned watching Law & Order: Old coot Division.
Well, l'm sorry l'm such a geezer, but it didn't seem to bother anybody when l was writing 1 5 straight number ones for Hannah Montana, none of which involved a face full of sputum.
-Sputum? -l think it's old-coot for ''spit.
'' Y'all like the next Hannah, right? One second.
We hate her.
-Why? -She scares us.
-What do you guys know? -Maybe they know what's good.
Please, they wouldn't know what good is if it hit them in the face.
Hey, leave us out of your little disputum.
-Nice wordplay.
-Thank you.
Well, at least we know the title of Hannah's next album.
Like Me or l'll Hit You in the Face.
Come on.
You guys are all just trying to keep me in a box.
And an artist has to keep moving.
And if you don't agree with me, l don't care! Miley, l'm sorry, but this is a really bad idea.
A bad, scary idea.
Honey, l don't wanna tell you what to do, but just Then don't! l know what l am doing and l am gonna prove it to you tomorrow.
The next Hannah is going to blow the roof off of the Sunshine Girls Benefit.
Sweet niblets.
l'm going to have to buy myself a truckload of Sunshine Girl cookies to get myself out of this one.
Well, that was the best day ever.
Here you go, Rover.
Who's a good boy? What is wrong with you? Couldn't you find something better to do with your day? You know, the next time you're bored, why don't you go hang out with your friends or something? Wait a minute.
You don't have any friends, do you? Hey, l got plenty of friends.
There's No, he's suing me.
Okay, but But there's No, l'm suing him.
l'm really good friends with my brother, Mateo.
Well, we will be if he ever agrees to settle out of court.
You know, Rico, maybe if you were just nice to people instead of making them dance like a monkey, people would actually want to hang out with you.
-Wait.
-What? You're right.
l shouldn't have made you do all that.
lt's just making friends isn't something l'm good at.
Well, gee, l wonder why.
l think it's because the world is full of idiots.
My mom says it's my attitude.
ldiot.
Look, Rico, did you ever think that maybe if you treated me a little better, l'd be your friend? Well, l was hoping for a higher-class friend, but Rico.
Right.
You'll really be my friend? No catch? Or condition.
So, you want to go back to my house and pay my brother to dance like a monkey? Rico.
Fine.
-Want to go see a movie? -Sure.
Hey, you want me to wrap you up like a baby, so you can get in for free? Jackson, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Nobody understands.
An artist has to grow.
Whee doggies! Howdy, l'm Robby Ray.
Let's kick it.
Yeah, we'll kick it, all right.
Anti-Hannah style.
Yeah, you're gonna see tomorrow, buddy.
You just l'm talking to a doll.
Yeah.

You were right.

He's a pencil sharpener.
You just lift his tail and l don't need to see that.
l never grow tired of you.
Dahli! Hannah! Darling, what are you doing here? l just came by to cancel my new Hannah look.

On second thought, send me that bullwhip.
l could use that on my brother.
Yes, yes, of course.
Well, bye-bye.

Little slow on the draw there, partner.
Dahliano, l love my new look! Awkward.
This is your next-next? Well, it seems to work for you.

You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe every colour Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun lt's really you but no one ever discovers Who would have thought that a girl like me Would double as a superstar?

Please, quick! Okay, all right.
Fine.
l won't ask her out.
Good call.
l picked up yours by mistake.
-Do you want to go out? -l'd love to.
-l need to use the bathroom.
-No problem, kid.
That'll be one dollar.
But l don't have a dollar.
You should've thought of that before you had that extra-large drink.
But you talked me into buying it.
Did l? Hi, so what's good here? You're looking at it.
And if you act right now, l'll throw in a romantic evening and an order of macho nachos.
Wow.
Well, talk about your value meal.
-l'm sorry.
Did that actually work? -No, but l've been watching you for a while and l think you're cute.
So when do l get that evening of romance? Let me check my schedule.
February, March, July How about tonight? What? Hey, Jackson.
l see you've met my cousin.
Your cousin? She's your cousin.
You are so funny.
l can't wait to see you tonight.
-Oh, boy.
-l know.
Cute, huh? Except for that weird laugh.
Annoying.
Little bit.
Okay, this is crazy.
lt's almost noon, and we haven't heard anything from Oliver about the date.
Come on, Lilly.
We've just got to think positive.
l mean, the date probably went awful, and he ran away in screaming terror.
Or it went great, and he's strolling towards us, happily in love.
Hey, guys.
Come on, Big-O.
Let's go some place with a nicer view.
Yeah, you better get her off the beach, ''Big-O.
'' Didn't you read the signs? No dogs allowed.
-You want to go, Truscott? -Bring it on, kite-cutter.
Hey, hey.
-Okay.
-Okay.
Listen, love-doodle, you promised you'd be nice.
-''Love-doodle''? -''Love-doodle''? Let me take care of this.
Go over to the boardwalk, and get yourself a ceramic dolphin.
-My treat.
-Thanks, Big-O.
Okay, guys, you know what? l really like her.
Can't you at least try to be nice to her? For me? Oliver, when you put it that way No.
-Some friends you are.
-Oliver, stop.
Can't you just give it a shot? lnvite her to a sleepover or something.
Like we'd ever have a sleepover with Joannie.
Fine, we'll invite her.
Girl-who-always-says-say-what say what? l can't believe you dragged me into this.
Just remember that it's for Oliver.
Fine.
Look, l set up her sleeping bag.
Are you happy? A rubber snake? -Come on, Lilly.
You're better than that.
-Yeah, l know.
lt's real.
Get that thing out of here! Look, l'll get rid of this snake if you get rid of that one.
Lilly.
Fine.
Come on, Wiggly.
You don't want to meet her anyway.
-And here we are.

-Whatever.
So, this is just gonna be so much fun.
What do you girls want to do tonight? -Puke.
-Leave.
Well, it can only go up from here.
l can't believe this.
Yeah, and l can't believe that you and Rico are from the same -Family? -l was gonna say species.
Okay, l'm really not that funny.
-l mean it.
Stop.
-Okay.
Hey-oh! ls something wrong? No, it's just sand in my eye.
Evil little grains of sand.
Now where were we? l've been waiting for this moment all night.
Sorry, l have to poop.
And now, Milda, it's your turn to travel with the pants.
Eat plasma, alien scum.
-Will you keep it down, Palumbo? -You keep it down, Truscott.
Make me.
You know, l was thinking we could do something a little more slumber-partyish.
How about a good old-fashioned pillow fight? -Actually, l was thinking -Sounds good to me! Or we could play a board game.
Or do our nails, or talk about Oliver.
Oliver.
How we love that he He He is bringing us together.
Just pick something.
Now, Lillian, l am sure there is a nicer way you could say that.
You're right.
Joannie, will you please just pick something? Fine! Life's what you make it How does she have a career? She's terrible.
Okay, it's official.
l hate her, too.
Now, Milian, l am sure there's a nicer way you can say that.
Look at that.
Her big fat lips don't even match that squeaky little voice.
That's it.
Yes, Oliver.
-How's it going? -Great.
Then why aren't you sitting with her? How do you know that? -Go home.
-Okay.
l love you guys for trying.
You're the best.
Bye.
What do we do now? We can't be friends with her.
We're doing this for Oliver.
The least we can do is fake it.
Fine.
Enough of this garbage.
Hockey, yes.
-l love hockey.
-You do? -Yeah, who doesn't like hockey? -Yeah, Miley likey hockey.
-Hey, is that Mario L'Chambeaux? -Yeah.
He's making another comeback.
lf the guy gets any older, they're gonna have to put blades on his walker.
No kidding.
Check it.
Looks like he had more face-lifts than face-offs.
Yeah, l bet he's so old, he, like, can't even shoot a touchdown.
No, Joannie.
We're 1 0,000 feet up.
Stop pushing! What? Stop Where's my parachute? Joannie! -That was horrible.
-Don't worry, it was just a bad dream.
l was talking about last night.
ln my dream, l went ''splat,'' but at least l got away from Joannie.
So, where is the Wicked Witch of the West Coast? She's in the bathroom.
Stealing soap, no doubt.
So, good job with the hockey thing last night.
-Way to fake it.
-Yeah, about that.
Somewhere between the hockey game and the spitting contest, it stopped being fake.
Girl-who-says-l-say-what say what? Well, first she wanted to put your bra in the freezer, but l said, ''No, let's go out on the deck and have a spitting contest instead.
'' Going to work.
By the way, it's a little slippery out there.
What do you mean you stopped faking? -What up, T-Cott? -Yo, yo, P-Bo.
Yo, yo How long was l asleep? -Hey, what was that thud? -Jackson took a dip in Lake Loogie.
-Sweet.
-l know.
You seem to have forgotten something.
We hate her.
We did, but now, not so much.
Hey, how'd it go? 'Cause l don't know 'cause l wasn't here.
We actually had fun, and Lilly's gonna play in the pick-up hockey game today.
-She is? -You are? -Didn't l tell you that? -See you at the rink, T-Cott.
Sock it, lock it, put it in your pocket.
This is so cool.
Well, look at that.
A room full of B-F-F-F-F-Fs.
l hadn't seen that many ''F''s since Jackson's last report card.
Dang, l'm funny.
Well, thanks T-Cott, l had a great time.
And, Miley, l Well, bye.
l'll see you at the game.
You know, you can come to the game, too, if you want.
How could you do this to me? Miley, if you'd just give Joannie a chance, you'll Give her a chance? She'd push me out of a plane.
-You were dreaming.
-She would've done it.
Well, can we talk about this later? l promised Joannie l'd warm up with her before the game.
Bye.
Did you see that, Daddy? They're all friends.
Well, that's just wrong.
Kids being friends, doing stuff together? There ought to be a law against it.
A law, l tell you! l'm serious.
They're already doing stuff without me after a couple of days.
Where's it gonna end? -Out of the way! -Out of the way! Get out of the way! -Out of the way! -Guys, wait for me! Hey, y'all.
Do you guys want to hang out today? -No way, Milly.
-We got a hockey game today.
l can't believe you were friends with that loser.
My name's Miley.
Come on, Mile.
Lilly and Oliver's never gonna forget about you.
You're right! They won't 'cause l'm not gonna let them.
lf they want to play hockey, l can hock it up with the best of them.
Hey.
-Jackson.
You feeling better? -Yeah.
Yeah, l'm fine.
Look, about last night.
lt wasn't really my stomach.
The truth is, l've got this thing with Rico and l just need One sec.
What? No, Miley, l don't have a hockey stick.
l don't know.
Try a sporting goods store or Canada.
Hey, thanks for waxing my board.
l'll finish up.
-Your board's in the back.
-Cool.
l don't care.
l'm busy.
Bye-bye.
-Man, it's getting worse.
-What's getting worse? Just don't talk.
Please, l need to get over this, and there's only one way to do that.
Jackson, what are you What l should've done last night.
l really like you, and this is gonna fix everything.
-Jackson, what are you doing? -l was going to ask the same question! This is not what it looks like.
He said you were weird.
lf this is your way of trying to kiss up to the boss, it's not working.
-Hey, Big-O.
-Hey, Jo-Jo.
You know, you looked great out there.
Nice outfit, Stewart.
Playing hockey or baking a cake? Good one, P-Bo.
-Who's the dork? -lt's Miley.

That's great.
You look great.

Miley, l'm really glad you're here, but are you sure you wanna do this? Yeah.

Hey, l caught it.
Daddy.

Are my brownies ready? Look, Miley.
Here comes Oliver with more ice.
You remember Oliver.
Are you feeling any better, Miley? No.
l'm beat up, l smell like a giant sweat sock, and ''P-Bo'' is stealing my best friends.
What? What are you talking about? She's not stealing anybody.
But you're right about that sweat sock.
lt's a little stanky.
Miley, do you really think just because l kind of like Joannie now, it means l'm not gonna be your best friend any more? Well, yeah, maybe a little.
l mean, l thought l was losing you guys.
l wasn't thinking l'm injured.
Be nice! Miley, you're always gonna be my best girl-bud.
-Hey! -One of my two best girl-buds.
But l don't like your girlfriend.
That's cool.
She doesn't like you, either.
But you tried, and that means a lot.
So, you don't care that l think that she's a wart on a big monkey butt? -ls that okay if l use that now? -All yours.
Look, l'm dating someone you don't like.
Odds are that we're gonna date people the other two can't stand.
Yeah.
You remember Josh? And Trey.
-And Jake.
-Oh, my gosh.
Guys, you made your point.
Look, the important thing is, we just have to trust that this is strong enough to handle anything.
You know, l could learn to like hockey.
Hi, what's good here? You're looking at it.
And if you act right now, l'll throw in an evening of romance and an order of macho nachos.

Roxy Roker! Hello, Clarice.
You must be Jackson and Robby.
You know, l gotta tell you, l thought you made the whole thing up.
You know something? Nobody, and l mean nobody, in our entire class ever expected that Roxy would ever find a man.
ln fact, she was voted ''most likely to die alone.
'' Look, when you walk into that reunion with that man on your arm, everybody who ever thought you were a man, they're gonna owe you an apology.
Listen, about that, l got to Hey, no need to apologise.

You'd like that, wouldn't you, you walking pom-pom? Hey, Rico, are you not feeling good? That's too bad because this food is really good.
See? Oh, no.
Oh, no! Hannah! Come on, he's driving me crazy, too, but the poor kid is sick.
And he's ruining our date.
Don't you see? He's not mean because he's sick.
He's mean because he's evil! How do you know he's evil? You just met him.
l can read people.
lt's a gift.
See, you're hot and he's Yes! l should have thought of that an hour ago.
l paid 20 grand for this? That's it.
l'm out of here.
Wait, Johnny.
Johnny, where are you going? As far away from you as l can get.
l thought you'd be cool and down-to-earth, like your songs.
Nobody's Perfect.
You ain't even close.
Johnny! Come back! Way to get rid of the third wheel.
Look, Robby Ray, can you believe that that's the girl you fell in love with? l still can't believe it.
Every day with this beautiful woman feels like the first.
l know exactly what you mean, Edward.
Look.
Roberta Franklin.
You know, l hear she's still single, packing groceries in a supermarket.
She'll probably never show up this evening.
Well, you don't know.
l mean, she may not be a millionaire with a gorgeous husband, but she may be perfectly happy with her life.
Please, how could anybody be happy with a life like that? lt's possible.
l mean, you can get through a lot if you're surrounded by people who love you.
Well, l can tell you one thing, if l see her tonight, l'm not speaking to her.
l will.
ln fact, l'll sit with her.
lt turns out l have more in common with her than l do with you.
What's gotten into you? Pride.
Pride in myself and who l really am.
Now l'm gonna say something l should've said the minute that you came in here.
-What? -Get out of my house! Go on, get! Way to go, Clarice.
This is why we don't have any friends.
Don't worry.
l'll tell her the truth at the reunion.
lf l even speak to her.
And thanks, Robby.
Thank you for everything.
Okay, honeymoon's over.
Just one more second, snuggle-puss.
l am so glad l'm done with that flu.
Yeah, the only thing good about getting sick is you feel so great when it's over.
lf l live that long.
l feel awful.
-Poor Miley.
-Poor both of me.
Johnny barely noticed Miley and now he hates Hannah.
This might not make you feel better, but sometimes things happen for a reason.
Maybe it just wasn't meant to be with you and Johnny.
Yeah.
You're right.
That didn't make me feel any better.
You know, Miley, it's true.
l mean, if l've learned anything in my past with the ladies, it's Don't wear your ''l'm a chick magnet'' T-shirt? That was one time, Lilly.
Anyways, l was gonna say, if the universe doesn't want you and Johnny together, -there's nothing you can do about it.
-Yeah.
And if the universe wants to change its mind, then -How do l look? -A little green.
lt's a cute green.
lt's a really cute green.
Miley? Miley Stewart? Hi.
l haven't seen you in, like, two years.
-You look great.
-Thanks.
So do you.
l heard you had a date with Hannah Montana.
Yeah, what a disaster that was.
Sorry, that's too bad.
She wasn't for me anyway.
l like girls who are more down-to-earth.
Kind of like l remember you were.
Really? -Yeah, really.
-l And the universe has spoken.
And it had shrimp last night.
Who you trying to kid, boy? That's right, Daddy.
l'm deep.
l just wanted you to love me.
